It seemed like absolute magic (and it still does).  \n\nSince then, I love (re)discovering the language every chance I get.\n\nI found this post incredibly well done with some great examples. I wish we had resources like this \u0026quot;back in my day‚Äù.  \n\n[C Primer](https://www.enlightenment.org/docs/c/start)\n\n",
