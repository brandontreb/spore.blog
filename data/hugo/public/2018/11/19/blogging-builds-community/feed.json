  "content": "It\u0026#39;s been around 3 weeks since I started [blogging every weekday](http://www.brandontreb.com/on-blogging-more-frequently.html).  This experience has been nothing short of delightful.\n\nWhile I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.  \n\nWhen I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple\u0026#39;s dreaded NDA. I absolutely **loved** the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.  I have been blogging on and off since then and have never felt that same spark.\n\nThis all changed, when I made a commitment to writing daily short-form blog posts and posting them to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/brandontreb) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/brandontreb).  I began to receive comments, and these comments turned into _real_ discussions.\n\nThis has been a blast as I\u0026#39;m now able to connect with so many wonderful people in the community.  We are sharing thoughts and ideas and challenging each other’s beliefs on tech, business, etc…\n\nSo, I challenge you. If you are on the fence, just stop worrying about the quality/frequency/etc... of your writing and just write.  And once you have written, share it with others.  I promise you, the community you will build is worth it!\n\n",
