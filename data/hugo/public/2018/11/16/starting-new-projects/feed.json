  "content": "I had the amazing opportunity today to hit **File -\u0026gt; New Project** today. There are few feelings in the world as great as the optimism that comes from starting a brand new project. \n\n“This one will be different”, I murmur to myself. “I will keep it clean, organized, and free from hacks. “, I cheerfully gloat. \n\nWhy is it that it’s so hard to follow through on this philosophy? I said it [yesterday](http://www.brandontreb.com/client-deliveries-are-hard.html), coding is hard. Requirements change, clients change, and most notibly, we change. \n\n“End of the project Brandon” is usually cursing “Beginning of the project Brandon” for using some library, not commenting his code, or lazily failing to follow best practices. \n\nBut not this time, oh no. This time WILL BE different... \n\n_(follow up post to come in 3 months making fun of this one)_\n\n",
