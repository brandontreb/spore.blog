  "content": "It’s often much easier to have a sense of gratitude when things are going well. As humans, we are prone to focusing on the one bad thing that’s going wrong rather than the multitude of good things going right. This traces way back to a time where we needed this sense to stay away from danger. \n\nMy father-in-law was just admitted to the hospital with lukeumia. Although this is one of the harder times in our family’s lives, it’s really been a sobering experience giving me a stronger sense of gratitude for my wife and kids. \n\nI appreciate them more now than ever and am grateful for their health and spirit. \n\nI wish you and your family blessings today, and pray that you too can always find gratitude, even in tribulation. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\n\n",
