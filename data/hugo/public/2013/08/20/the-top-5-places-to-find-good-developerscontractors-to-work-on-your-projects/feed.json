  "content": "One thing I am often asked is \u0026#8220;Where can I find good developers/contractors/subcontractors?\u0026#8221; While I have found talent many different ways, I wanted to share my top 5 with you.\n\nThis post should be useful to you if you have a project and are looking to find a developer OR are a developer looking to subcontract some of your work. Â I am sharing these based solely on my experiences with them and hope you find value in this list.\n\n### 1. Local Meetups\n\nLocal meet ups are the absolute best place in my opinion to find developers. Â Almost every city in the nation has some sort of group meeting on a regular bases for a given focus of development. Â You should have no problems finding a rails meetup group, iOS, Android, etc\u0026#8230;\n\nI would suggest finding out about such meetups in your area by Googling phrases such as \u0026#8220;[your area] iOS meetup (sub iOS for rails, python, etc\u0026#8230;). Â I regularly attend a \u0026#8220;Cocoa Heads\u0026#8221; group full of incredibly smart and capable mobile developers all willing to work on projects.\n\nThese types of groups are always excited to have clients come in and pitch their ideas. Â One piece of advice though, don\u0026#8217;t go in to these groups and start with \u0026#8220;I have a great idea and I will give you a percentage of the company in exchange for development\u0026#8221;. They will stop listening immediately.\n\n### 2. Popular Developers/Mailing Lists\n\nThis one is going to require a bit of work and research on your part, but I will get you started. Â Around the internet, there are a few of what I call \u0026#8220;celebrity developers\u0026#8221;. Â These are generally guys who have made a name for themselves and who are established as experts in their space.\n\nWhile many of them are not taking on contract work themselves, they may or may not have a mailing list of interested contractors. Â One such person that does exactly this is [Ray Wenderlich][1]Â and I happen to receive emails on his contractor list.\n\nEven if these developers don\u0026#8217;t have lists, they generally have plenty of connections to point you in the right direction. Â Like I said, this method isn\u0026#8217;t easy, but it can definitely have one of the biggest payoffs in terms of quality developers.\n\n### 3. Specialize Project Sites\n\nAs of late, quite a few interesting sites have been popping up that have solved a fundamental issue when it comes to pairing developers with projects. The problems are 1. it\u0026#8217;s hard to find good developers and 2. it\u0026#8217;s hard to find clients with realistic cost expectations. That\u0026#8217;s why ODesk exists ðŸ˜‰\n\nThe first of these sites that I have found is [OOOMF][2]. Â OOOMF is relatively new and you must be reviewed and accepted by their team in order to be a part of it. Â It\u0026#8217;s basically a private network for pairing developers with projects and it supports all different project types (mobile, web, design, etc\u0026#8230;).\n\nProject owners can put their project up with a relative budget and developers can \u0026#8220;apply\u0026#8221;. Â The process then moves forward with communication between the client and the developers until a price and scope have been reached.\n\nThere is an additional overhead of 15% for using this service, but I think it\u0026#8217;s well worth it.\n\nAnother one of these sites that is more mobile centric is[Â http://apphappening.com][3]. Â This site is very new and I have only just begun to use it. Â I should have a better review of them shortly.\n\n### 4. Twitter and App.net\n\nTwitter and app.net are definitely the preferred social network of serious developers. Â I would steer clear of Facebook and Linked in as this is generally where the recruiters hang out. Your message will most likely get dismissed as spam.\n\nI\u0026#8217;d suggest searching Twitter/App.net for the keywords of your project (iOS developer, rails, etc\u0026#8230;) and find the folks with a ton of follows and a very small following to follower ratio. You will know them right away. Â Also, most of their blogs come up first in Google for many related keywords.\n\n### 5. Developer Conferences\n\nThis one might cost you a bit of money, but is definitely well worth it. Â There are conferences for every focus of software development and they occur all throughout the year. Â These conferences generally have a HUGE percentage of professional developers who are just as eager to work on a project as you are to have them.\n\nOne of my favorite iOS conferences is [360iDev][4]. It\u0026#8217;s very indie-centric and offers an incredible community of iOS developers of all abilities. Â If you are looking to get a mobile project done, I strongly urge you to attend. Â While I can\u0026#8217;t speak for conferences in other areas(web, etc..), I would really love some suggestions in the comments of this post if you are up for it!\n\n### 6. Bonus \u0026#8211; Right Here\n\nShameless plug time. Â If you are looking for professional mobile app (iOS or Android), I have a team of developers and am always looking to work on new and exciting projects. Â If you want to hear more about it head over to my [Hire Us][5] page or shoot me an email brandon @ pixegon [dot] com.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhether you are a person/company looking to hire developers or a developer looking to hire contractors, I hope you have found this post useful. Â Your feedback in the comments is greatly appreciated. Â Best of luck with your search!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"The Top 5 Places To Find Good Software Developers/Contractors\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/the-top-5-places-to-find-good-developerscontractors-to-work-on-your-projects\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://raywenderlich.com\n [2]: http://ooomf.com\n [3]: http://apphappening.com\n [4]: http://360idev.com\n [5]: http://pixegon.com/\n",
