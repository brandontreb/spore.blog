I had the first version of what is now the \u003ca title=\"\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePebble\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca title=\"\" href=\"http://getinpulse.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einPulse\u003c/a\u003e) and even hacked a jailbroken iOS app to interface with it.\n\n\u003ca title=\"\" href=\"http://metawatch.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMetaWatch\u003c/a\u003e has been around for quite some time now and looks *ok *, however their latest update appears to be completely in response to Allerta\u0026#8217;s announcement/success of Pebble.\n\n\u003e \u0026#8220;We are delighted to be the first company to ship a Bluetooth 4.0 smartwatch compatible with both iPhone and Android platforms\u0026#8221;\n\nWhat is really concerning is the fact they they don\u0026#8217;t mention anything related to how they are achieving iOS notifications. Pebble has been very upfront in stating that they are planning on leveraging \u003ca title=\"\" href=\"http://ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eifttt.com\u003c/a\u003e to deliver complex notifications such as Twitter and Facebook. It leads me to believe they haven\u0026#8217;t quite sorted everything out and are jumping to a press release in order to ride the smartwatch train.\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  I have a \u003ca title=\"\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android\" target=\"\"\u003ePebble\u003c/a\u003e coming in August and intend on sharing my experiences as well as code.
