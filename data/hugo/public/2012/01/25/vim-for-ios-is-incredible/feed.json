  "content": "I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn\u0026#8217;t until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.\n\nLast week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing [Vim has been ported to iOS][1]. I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/overview.jpg?13270539\" width=\"400\" /\u003e\n\nIt has *most* of the major Vim features and commands including:\n\n  * Automatic indentation\n  * Visual mode (block operations)\n  * Language-aware syntax highlighting\n  * Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities\n  * Macros recording and playback\n  * Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)\n  * Multiple clipboards\n\nYou even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.\n\nThere are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:\n\n  1. Dropbox Support \u0026#8211; Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.\n  2. Keyboard bar \u0026#8211; Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( \u0026#8220;:\u0026#8221; ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.\n  3. Plugin support \u0026#8211; This is an Apple limitation \u003cimg src=\"http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /\u003e\n  4. NERDTree \u0026#8211; The file browser that\u0026#8217;s built in doesn\u0026#8217;t work too well.\n\nWith Vim mobile, you can now look *even more* nerdy on your iPhone ðŸ˜‰\n\n[Download Vim For iOS][2]\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Vim For iOS Is Incredible\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/vim-for-ios-is-incredible\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/\n [2]: http://itunes.apple.com/app/vim/id492668168\n",
