  "content": "It cannot be overstated that writing down one’s goals is critical to acheiving them. Pair that with sharing them with others who might help keep you accountable and your probabilty of achieving those goals goes way up.\n\nWith this in mind, I have decided to share my 2015 goals here on my blog in hopes that I will do a better job of acheiving them in the new year. I tried to focus on more measurable goals rather than things like \u0026#8220;eat better\u0026#8221; and \u0026#8220;exercise more\u0026#8221;.\n\nSo, here they are in no particular order.\n\n**Professional**\n\n  * Create a business plan\n  * Grow \u003ca href=\"http://pixegon.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePixegon\u003c/a\u003e (my mobile consultancy) to 2x 2014 revenue\n  * Hire a “director” to help with oversight of current developers\n  * Move to a weekly rate instead of hourly\n\n**Personal**\n\n  * Be consistent with morning routine \n      * wake up early, pray, blog, mediate, read Bible, write down \u003ca href=\"http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMITs\u003c/a\u003e,\n\n  * Blog twice a month\n  * Grow the blog’s mailing list\n  * Take off / reduce workload on Friday’s to spend the day with my family\n  * Launch \u003ca href=\"http://alpha.autumnv.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAutumn Village\u003c/a\u003e\n  * Give away more than 10% of personal income\n\nThis list is definitely not complete, however it’s a good start. I hope to refine it over the coming months and more importantly, stick with it.\n\nWhat are your 2015 goals? I would love to hear about them in the comments or [via email][1].\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Goals For 2015\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/goals-2015\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: mailto://brandon@brandontreb.com\n",
