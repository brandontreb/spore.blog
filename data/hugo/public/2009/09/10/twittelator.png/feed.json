  "content": "\u003e TweetPress is the WordPress plugin that gives you total control and ownership of the photos you post to Twitter, sending your traffic back to your own blog, instead of a third party site\n\nI just finished development of this WordPress plugin and Andrew Stone of Twittelator has integrated it into his latest version of [Twittelator Pro][1]. As of this post, that version is still in review, so you will have to wait until it is approved to make use of TweetPress.\n\nI have some other very big plans for future releases of TweetPress and if you have any feature requests, feel free to drop me a line. I will do a post as soon as the latest version of Twittelator is approved and demo how it integrates with TweetPress.\n\n\u003cimg style=\"display:none\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-489\" title=\"Twittelator\" src=\"/uploads/2009/Twittelator.png\" alt=\"Twittelator\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" /\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"TweetPress coming soon to a Twitter Client Near You\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/tweetpress-coming-soon-to-a-twitter-client-near-you\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://stone.com/Twittelator/index.html\n",
