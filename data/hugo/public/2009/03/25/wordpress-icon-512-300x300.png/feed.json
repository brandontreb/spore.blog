The main features included in the update were:\n\n  * Landscape mode for writing posts \u0026#8211; This is a huge one. It was a total pain in the butt writing blog posts with the vertical keyboard\n  * Page Editing/Creation \u0026#8211; Meh\u0026#8230; How often do you do this?\n  * Comment Moderation \u0026#8211; Very excited about this feature. I love being able to check out comments quickly without loading my entire blog.\n  * Photo resizing \u0026#8211; Very cool option. Makes photo uploads go much quicker.\n\nIf you have both an iPhone AND a WordPress blog (your own host or WordPress.com), I would highly suggest [downloading][3] the WordPress iPhone app for blogging on the go.\n\nHopefully, having the landscape keyboard mode will motivate me to blog more often.\n\n[Click here][3] to download the WordPress application for the iPhone\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Wordpress For iPhone Gets A Much Needed Update\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-for-iphone-gets-a-much-needed-update\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/wordpress-icon-512.png\n [2]: http://wordpress.org\n [3]: http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285073074\u0026mt=8\n",
