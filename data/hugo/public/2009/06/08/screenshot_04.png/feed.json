The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in \u0026#8220;test data\u0026#8221; and when it comes time for release, the can\u0026#8217;t modify it.\n\nAnother feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.\n\nWell, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. [Write me on Twitter][2] or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"iPhoneLB.com gets a much needed update\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/iphonelb-com-gets-a-much-needed-update\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://iphonelb.com\n [2]: http://twitter.com/brandontreb\n",
