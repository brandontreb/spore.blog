We had to run a patch otherwise there was a hideous banner that was plastered along the top :)\r\n\r\nBTW, your blog has been a huge source of inspiration. I have spent the last 6 months building an indie web-centric single-user blog engine (my site is currently running it).  Your tools (Im currently posting on Quill) and documentation have been absolutely invaluable! So, thank you so much for all of the hard work you have done and continue to do. I look forward to contributing to this amazing community!\n",
