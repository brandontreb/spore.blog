These methods require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that they are still supporting TOTP and others for non Twitter Blue subscribers?\r\n\r\nIf so, thatâ€™s _still_ a weird choice (to ditch SMS and keep others) as those are much more technical methods of auth than SMS. I would imagine most of their user base would have no idea how to set up apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. \r\n\r\nSuch an odd move. \n",
