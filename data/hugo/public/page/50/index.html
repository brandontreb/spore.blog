    Mondays&#8230;
  </p>
</div>
<p>The other day, I was faced with an interesting programming challenge and wanted to share my solution. I just submitted a pretty interesting app to the app store that does a number of things (more details soon). Among those things is the ability to generate a calendar.</p>
<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>
<p>Generating the calendar was the easy part, however when displayed, I wanted it to highlight every Monday of the month. This turned out to be a bit trickier than I imagined.</p>
<p>Really the main challenge here was to determine which day contained the <em>first</em> Monday of the month. After that, we just loop incrementing by 7 and are done.</p>
<h4 id="looking-at-the-date-helpers">Looking At The Date Helpers</h4>
<p>Looking at what I had to work with in NSDate, NSCalendar, and NSDateComponents, I really found only 2 things that could help me. From NSDateComponents, I could figure out the current day (numeric) and the current day of the week (numeric). Knowing this information was very important.</p>
<h4 id="the-solution">The Solution</h4>
<p>Having the current day and day of the week allowed me to find the date of the Monday on the current week. This was the first challenge as demonstrated below. Assume weekdayComponents is the NSDateComponents generated from the current date.</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôobjc‚Äô>NSInteger weekday = [weekdayComponents weekday];
NSInteger day         = [weekdayComponents day];
<p>// First, find how many days we are from Monday
int daysAwayFromMonday = weekday - 2;</p>
<p>// Now resolve the monday of this week
int mondayThisWeek = day - daysAwayFromMonday;</p>
<p>// Check if monday this week falls in last month
if(mondayThisWeek &lt;= 0) {
mondayThisWeek = day + (7 - daysAwayFromMonday);
}&lt;/code&gt;</pre></p>
</div>
<p>mondayThisWeek will now contain the day number of the Monday of the current week. If that Monday falls on the previous month, mondayThisWeek will be negative. Line 12 resolves that by carrying it into next week.</p>
<p>Finally, we just loop subtracting 7 from that Monday until mondayThisWeek is less than 7 to get the first Monday of the month.</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôobjc‚Äô>while(mondayThisWeek &gt; 7) {
    mondayThisWeek -= 7;
}&lt;/code></pre>
</div>
<p>And there you have it. mondayThisWeek (improperly named at this point) will contain the day number of the first Monday for the current month.</p>
<p>So, this was quite a round-a-bout way to find this value. If you have a better solution, please feel free to trash on mine in the comments üòâ .</p>

</p>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I wanted to thank everyone for letting me be a part of the iDevBlogADay community. You guys have been super supportive and I really appreciate all of the commenting, retweeting, and upvoting of my iDevBlogADay articles.</p>
<p>I have found myself in a position with life (work + family) where I may no longer be able to consistently write a post per week. So, after 2 months of writing, it is time for me to pass the torch to the next blogger on the list.</p>
<p>I will still continue to blog (and continue my Twitter For Mac Series), so I really encourage you to subscribe to my <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/brandontreb">RSS feed</a> (or <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">Twitter feed</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks again and Happy Coding!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Imagine that you have just found the coolest app in the world and just can‚Äôt wait to tell all of your followers about it. So, you head to the admin panel of your blogging engine (hopefully <a href="http://wpwithlove.com">WordPress</a>) and begin to write your review. Now, you want to insert some screenshots, icons, descriptions, app store links, etc‚Ä¶ So, what do you do? You head on over to Bing and type in google.com. Next, you search your app name and hopefully find the iTunes URL so that you can slowly grab some information about the app. <span style="color: #ff0000;">#Fail</span></p>
<p>Dum duh dum duh (trumpet noises)!</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger" target="_blank">AppBlogger</a>. <a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger" target="_blank">AppBlogger</a> is a little tool that I have been working on that uses ‚ÄúInstant Search‚Äù technology (jquery fanciness) to allow you to instantly search the app store and <strong>quickly</strong> get the information you need.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1383" title="Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 7.17.04 PM" src="/uploads/2011/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-7.17.04-PM.png" alt="" width="539" height="468" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong> (you say)</p>
<p>As you start typing, <a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger/" target="_blank">AppBlogger</a> makes an asynchronous request to the iTunes web service and pulls a list of applications that match your search terms. This list is presented as a bunch of icons. You will then click on one of these icons to pull of the details page of that application.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1387 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 7.25.52 PM" src="/uploads/2011/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-7.25.52-PM.png" alt="" width="219" height="227" />
<p>The details page (see above screenshot) then contains everything you need to write a stellar blog post about that application. It provides text fields (for easy copy and paste) with icon URLs, download URL, and screenshot URLs.</p>
<p>I have some plans to integrate this in the <em>near</em> future with my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/linkshare">Link Share</a> tool to auto generate shortened URLs that contain your affiliate code (so you can make $). If you have any other suggestions for it, I would love to hear them.</p>
<p>I know many of you are heartbroken and were expecting the next iteration of my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-part-1/">Twitter Client For Mac</a> series. I want you to know, you are not forgotten and I will continue the series next Thursday. So Stay Tuned!</p>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Grayscale Jobs
  </p>
</div>
<p>With the recent success of cool photo manipulation apps such as Camera+ and Instagram, it got me wondering. How do these photo apps modify the pixel data of the image.</p>
<p>After doing a bit of research on the subject, I found countless posts on Stack Overflow and the Developer forums about various methods to get and set the pixel values of a UIImage. Most of them unanswered or partially answered. I tested out many solutions and banged my head on my computer into the whee hours of the morning with no success. Every solution I tried seemed to completely destroy the image.</p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt until this morning, I had an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment, changed one line of code and was able to produce a grayscale version of a UIImage.</p>
<p>Having the ability to get and set pixel values of a UIImage is super important if you want to create a photo related app that has ‚ÄúFilters‚Äù. Once you know the basics, you can apply your ninja math skillz to implement cool filter algorithms on the pixels. Below, I will show you onc such algorithm for converting an image to grayscale (it‚Äôs not <em>that</em> clever).</p>
<p>I should note, that a good majority of my code comes from Olie‚Äôs solution on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/448125/how-to-get-pixel-data-from-a-uiimage-cocoa-touch-or-cgimage-core-graphics">Stack Overflow post</a>. His example simply returns and array of UIColor objects for a given image. Mine will modify those colors and write them back to a UIImage.</p>
<h4 id="converting-a-uiimage-into-a-pixel-array">Converting A UIImage Into A Pixel Array</h4>
<p>Here is the first part of our grayscale method. It is creating a char array from a global UIImage property named workingImage.</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôobjc‚Äô>- (IBAction) grayscale:(id) sender {
    CGContextRef ctx;
    CGImageRef imageRef = [self.workingImage CGImage];
    NSUInteger width = CGImageGetWidth(imageRef);
    NSUInteger height = CGImageGetHeight(imageRef);
    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
    unsigned char *rawData = malloc(height * width * 4);
    NSUInteger bytesPerPixel = 4;
    NSUInteger bytesPerRow = bytesPerPixel * width;
    NSUInteger bitsPerComponent = 8;
    CGContextRef context = CGBitmapContextCreate(rawData, width, height,
    bitsPerComponent, bytesPerRow, colorSpace,
    kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Big);
    CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);
<pre><code>CGContextDrawImage(context, CGRectMake(0, 0, width, height), imageRef);
CGContextRelease(context);
.
.
.&amp;lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is a lot of Core Graphics fanciness that isn‚Äôt super important to understand. It‚Äôs just getting the RGBA values from the image and writing them into the rawData char array. There are 4 bytes per pixel (red, green, blue, alpha), so this array contains 4 * height * width elements.</p>
<h4 id="modifying-the-pixels-of-a-uiimage">Modifying The Pixels of a UIImage</h4>
<p>Here is where the magic happens. You can replace this code with the logic necessary to apply the filter you are making. Another clever way to approach this would be to pass this code in as a block into the method (I‚Äôll leave that as an exercise for the reader :)).</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôobjc‚Äô>.
.
.
    int byteIndex = 0;
    for (int ii = 0 ; ii &lt; width * height ; ++ii)
    {
    int outputColor = (rawData[byteIndex] + rawData[byteIndex+1] +
        rawData[byteIndex+2]) / 3;
<pre><code>rawData[byteIndex] = (char) (outputColor);
rawData[byteIndex+1] = (char) (outputColor);
rawData[byteIndex+2] = (char) (outputColor);

    byteIndex += 4;
}
</code></pre>
<p>.
.
.&lt;/code&gt;</pre></p>
</div>
<p>The first part is pretty straight forward, we have a for loop that goes from 0 to width * height. We index into the rawData array using a counter that we increment by 4 each time (remember 4 bytes per pixel). As you can imagine, the first pixel (rawData[byteIndex]) represents the red pixel, then green for +1, blue for +2, and finally alpha for +3. Note that the alpha byte is last because kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast flag above.</p>
<p>In order to do grayscale, we simple set all of the color values to the average color value. So, for example the color [218,232,244] (which is the light blue color of the WordPress editor‚Äôs toolbar) would be converted to [231,231,231] which is a fairly light gray color.</p>
<p>The most important step that everyone in the forums seemed to miss was casting the new value to a char. Remember we are using a char array, setting ints as values will generally screw up your image. (This was my ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment that I mentioned above)</p>
<h4 id="writing-the-pixels-back-to-a-uiimage">Writing The Pixels Back To a UIImage</h4>
<p>The final step is to write the pixel data back to a UIImage. Again, I borrowed some of this code from somewhere else and unfortunately lost the link. If I find it, I will update the post.</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôobjc‚Äô>.
.
.
    ctx = CGBitmapContextCreate(rawData,
        CGImageGetWidth( imageRef ),
        CGImageGetHeight( imageRef ),
        8,
        CGImageGetBytesPerRow( imageRef ),
        CGImageGetColorSpace( imageRef ),
        kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast ); 
<pre><code>imageRef = CGBitmapContextCreateImage (ctx);
UIImage* rawImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imageRef];  

CGContextRelease(ctx);  

self.workingImage = rawImage;  

free(rawData);
</code></pre>
<p>}&lt;/code&gt;</pre></p>
</div>
<p>All we are doing here is creating a new Bitmap Context, writing it to our CGImageRef and constructing a new UIImage from that CGImageRef. Finally, we just update our workingImage with the modified one. Fancy, I know‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Now, much of this code is to work with my example (download below), but it could easily be tweaked to fit within your super awesome photo app. If you have any questions or comments PLEASE leave them here or send them to me on Twitter (but probably leave them here üòâ ).</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I am always very fascinated with the workspaces of others and frequently check out Lifehacker‚Äôs posts on their <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-workspace/">featured workspaces</a>. So, for this iDevBlogADay post, I thought I would keep it short and simple with a request. I want to see (and I‚Äôm sure others do too) photos of YOUR workspaces (especially those of you with s<a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/my-standing-desk-experiment">tanding desks</a>).</p>
<p>Seeing someone‚Äôs work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.</p>
<p>So, I‚Äôll start by sharing a photo of my current workspace. This is where the magic happens‚Ä¶</p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1341" title="image" src="/uploads/2010/image.jpeg" alt="" width="548" height="409" />
<p>Within my workspace, you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macbook Pro</li>
<li>24‚Äù Apple LED Display</li>
<li>iPad with Kensington Keyboard Case</li>
<li>Logitec Speakers</li>
<li>‚ÄúJust Like Jesus‚Äù Daily Devotional</li>
<li>Embark (Target Brand) Fitness Ball</li>

</ul>
<p>So there you have, this is my workspace. Please post a link to your workspace photos or email them to brandontreb [at] gmail [dot] com and I will append them to this post. I can‚Äôt wait!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2010/12/28/free.jpeg/">Free App Per Day Service</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" title="free" src="/uploads/2010/free.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />
</p>
<p>As many of you may know, I created a site called <a href="http://freshapps.com">Fresh Apps</a>. This site started as sort of a Digg for developer submitted iPhone apps. Since then, we have added plenty of new features and have grown a community of over 10,000 iPhone users.</p>
<p>Recently, I have noticed a few services sprout up that basically have a schedule of apps that shift from paid to free for a given day. The most notable being <a href="http://freeappaday.com">Free App A Day</a>.</p>
<p>After doing some research, sites such as these are charging a significant amount of money (I have heard up to $10,000) for a 1 day feature.</p>
<p>So, I was curious, given our user base, what do you (fellow iOS) developers think of FreshApps offering a similar service? If we did offer a similar service, here are some questions I have (and would love your feedback).</p>
<ol>
<li>How would you change existing services? What new features would you like to see? what features are worthless?</li>
<li>How much would you pay for such a feature?</li>
<li>Would you be interested in having your app featured the first month for a minimal cost ($1 or so)?</li>
<li>Would you use an iPhone app that lists the upcoming paid to free apps?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you all so much for your feedback. I‚Äôm just in the brainstorming time of this, but I will totally keep you up to date if anything comes of it.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"><img class="alignleft" title="Standard Theme" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/themes/StandardTheme_20/screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I seem to change my WordPress theme more often than I change my socks. I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.</p>
<p>After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<a href="http://brownbishop.com">http://brownbishop.com</a>), I fell in love with the<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"> Standard WordPress Theme</a>. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it‚Äôs also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.</p>
<p>So, I urge you to <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302">check it out</a>, It‚Äôs kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2010/12/23/dali-clock.jpeg/">Changing Your Life In 2011</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>For this blog post, I decided to take a small break from my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-%E2%80%93-part-3-publishing-tweets/">Twitter Client for Mac</a> tutorial series and discuss something a little more useful üòâ . I felt that a fitness post would be most appropriate around this time of year as all of our ‚ÄúGeek Guts‚Äù begin expanding.</p>
<h4 id="my-fitness-story">My Fitness Story</h4>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/geek-gut.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1306" title="geek-gut" src="/uploads/2010/geek-gut.png" alt="" width="256" height="352" /></a>It‚Äôs December 23rd and as we gear up for Christmas, we are also compiling our New Year‚Äôs resolutions. And I‚Äôm sure that on most people‚Äôs (especially us computer geeks) lists is something related to weight and a healthy lifestyle. So, I wanted to discuss a little bit about how I made fitness a priority in 2010 and how you can too in 2011.</p>
<p>I began my fitness journey at the beginning of 2010 where I weighed in at 185 lbs and had 19% body fat. Now, I am in not way saying that I was a thick dude. I have been blessed with a stellar metabolism, but I definitely didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúin shape‚Äù. More importantly I didn‚Äôt have a clue about living a healthy life style. Being a geek, I sat for hours at my desk every day, eating quick foods and drinking soda.</p>
<p>One night, I saw a commercial for the fitness program P90X and was actually very intrigued. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not including any affiliate links or things of that sort, so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to sell you on something. Needless to say, I went on YouTube to find out just how legit this program was. After some browsing, I was quite impressed and inspired. It seemed that after 3 short months (seriously no time), people had changed their entire life around in terms of health and fitness.</p>
<p>So, I did what any geek would do and took a visit to the <em>Bay</em> and acquired a copy from some <em>Pirates</em>. After checking out the program for a week or so, I was hooked and decided to go legit and purchase a copy. Within 3 months, I began to absolutely LOVE exercising, in fact I became a little addicted to it :/ . I learned how to track what foods I was intaking as well as replaced much of the crappy liquids I was drinking with water.</p>
<p>After completion of the program, I was down to 163lbs with a 12% body fat and have been exercising since. I‚Äôm not posting photos because I feel that would be in bad taste. Check out others on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=p90x&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p>Now, this is a really lengthy intro (kind of sounds spammy too, sorry), but the point is, it‚Äôs not hard to get into a healthy routine. I have talked to tons of people about my ‚Äútransformation‚Äù (I hate this term), and almost every person asks me how I got started. Everyone either feels that it‚Äôs too late for them, or they will start ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô. So, here is a formula for you lazy geeks (I can call you that because that‚Äôs what I was last year :))</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a copy of P90X. Again, I‚Äôm not a P90X salesmen, Pirate a copy if you have to. Just get one! If you want to buy it, it‚Äôs about the cost of 3 months of the gym, which coincidentally is the length of the program (90 days) $120</li>
<li>Buy a resistance band ‚Äì These are everywhere (target, walmart, big 5, etc‚Ä¶) ‚Äì $20</li>
<li>Buy a pull-up bar ‚Äì $30</li>
<li>Quit stalling ‚Äì Start this Monday and let me know how it goes <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this is just the beginning. The biggest problem with diets/fitness programs/etc is people don‚Äôt look at them as a lifestyle change, they see them as temporary. People say crap like ‚ÄúI want to be XYZlbs or fit into a size J‚Äù. Don‚Äôt do that! Sure these are nice goals to have, but DONT MAKE THEM THE REASON YOU EXERCISE AND EAT HEALTHY. If you do, you are just setting yourself up to fail. Exercise and don‚Äôt eat crap because you want to be healthy. Do it because you are sick of being tired and lethargic all the time.</p>
<h4 id="i-don8217t-have-time-to-exercise">I don‚Äôt have time to exercise</h4>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/dali-clock.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1308" title="dali-clock" src="/uploads/2010/dali-clock.jpeg" alt="" width="196" height="196" /></a>Of course you would say that‚Ä¶ I did too. That‚Äôs why I love P90X. It‚Äôs only 1 hour a day and within that hour, you are told exactly what to do. I always felt that to exercise, I had to spend hours in the gym, running, lifting, blah blah‚Ä¶ No, one hour a day. I spend that reading Reddit. Get up an hour earlier, go to bed an hour later. Stop eating on your lunch break and exercise then. You can always eat at your desk when you get back.</p>
<h4 id="staying-motivated">Staying Motivated</h4>
<p>So, you have decided that 2011 is going to be your year; you are going to get in shape. Here are a few tips to help you stay motivated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn, learn, learn ‚Äì Just as you spend time learning about new programming languages, or reading about yet another tablet device. Learn about new things to eat, new exercises to try, new goals. Whatever, just maintain the excitement by learning new things.</li>
<li>Get others involved ‚Äì This generally comes naturally. When others see you getting into shape, they will most likely want to join. This can be a great motivator, especially when you are feeling burnt out. Get a workout buddy to go to the gym, run, do P90x, etc‚Ä¶ with.</li>
<li>Find healthy things to consume that don‚Äôt suck ‚Äì This is a huge challenge for people starting out. They think that they have to eat celery and chicken breasts all day. This is one thing I love about p90x. It comes with an incredibly (and delicious) diet plan including recipes. In a future post, I‚Äôm going to write about a stellar protein smoothie that I have every day.</li>
<li>Get the crap out of your house ‚Äì I‚Äôm serious, you won‚Äôt miss it. Cookies, Soda, Doughnuts, whatever‚Ä¶</li>
<li>If you want soda, drink a soda ‚Äì A can of soda is roughly 120 calories, this isn‚Äôt terrible. But don‚Äôt make it a habbit. Limit yourself and throw away your effin Big Gulp cup!</li>
<li>Eat before you leave your house ‚Äì this is huge. If you are hungry and you are out, what do you do? You go scoop up a McFeeces from McDonalds‚Ä¶ Instead, eat some lunch meat or whatever before you go run those errands.</li>
<li>Eat frequently with smaller portions ‚Äì I told my dad that I eat about 5-7 times a day, and he responded with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to get fat doing that‚Äù Contrary to popular belief, it is far better for you to eat more frequent, smaller meals. This is tricky when you spend the day in the office. You have to somewhat plan your day in terms of food. Bring stuff to snack on such as nuts, popcorn, protein bars, and beef jerkey.</li>
<li>Share your success ‚Äì Blog, Tweet, Facebook, Youtube. Whatever it is, tell people about it. Others will surely praise you for this, and you will most likely motivate them. Plus, it will hold you accountable.</li>
<li>Get a good water bottle and take it everywhere ‚Äì Water is a tricky thing. It‚Äôs so hard to remember to drink enough. I have found that if I have water in front of me, I will always sip on it, especially when I‚Äôm sitting at my desk all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>To wrap this up, I‚Äôm not trying to sell you on P90X or any other fitness program. I just feel that it will be a killer start and give you all of the tools needed to launch into a healthier, more fit 2011. Also, you will start seeing results very quickly.</p>
