<p>I have been using lua in my iOS applications for some time now. This tutorial provides a great introduction to a scripting language that most developers are very curious about. I really suggest spending a few minutes checking it out.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2012/05/01/why-you-should-check-out-unity/">Why you Should Check Out Unity</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>A while back, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/seantron">seantron</a> showed me some of his 3D games he‚Äôd been working on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hamsteria!/id470730689?mt=8">including this one</a>. My initial reaction was ‚Äúhow the heck did he get the chopps to do that?‚Äù. While, Sean is an incredible developer with a ton of creativity, doing things like loading models, texture mapping, or even basic 3D projects are flippin hard.</p>
<p>A while back I <a href="http://brandontreb.com/ludum-dare-competition-week-2-update/">tried my hand at 3D</a> and made sort of a <em>basic</em> Minecraft style game from scratch using OpenGL ES. Let me tell you, it was brutal (and I have been coding for almost 10 years). This project took me a week or so to ramp up, get basic cubes and textures going and a simple first person view.</p>
<h4 id="enter-unity">Enter Unity</h4>
<p>Sean had mentioned to me that he used this 3D engine called Unity to create his games. While I had tried XNA, I had never heard of Unity and figured it was similar (basically a framework with some convenience methods for loading models, mapping, etc‚Ä¶). Boy was I wrong‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Unity 3D is more than just an engine. It is an application that allows even the most novice of developers to create beautiful, rich, 3D games. I‚Äôm serious. Check out this demo below of an app I made in unity in about 3 hours using <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">this tutorial</a>. The crazy part is, I wrote <em>almost</em> no code. Much of the interactions and game were developed using drag and drop and <strong>free</strong> assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1574088/unity/tuts-plus/TutsPlus.html">Link to my awesome game</a></p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p>I was very reluctant to learn Unity at first as the interface appears to be a bit daunting. However, once you check out a few tutorials, it becomes second nature. Here are a few places to get started:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWhtKjUr10">InfinitAmmo‚Äôs Unity 3D tutorial series</a> ‚Äì This was where I first began. He does a great job at going over the basics of Unity while keeping things interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">Getting Started With Unity on Active Tuts+</a> ‚Äì This is where I made the game you checked out above. Take an hour and do the first in the series, you will be very surprised with the outcome.</p>
<p><a href="http://unity3d.com/support/resources/tutorials/">Unity 3D tutorials</a> ‚Äì Unity has a wealth of information and demo projects on their website. They come with the source and comprehensive PDFs detailing various aspects of each of their demo games.</p>
<p>After completing at least the top two series‚Äô, you <em>should</em> have enough knowledge to begin hacking on a game of your own. I know that I do <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I hope this has been enlightening and I really urge you to check out Unity.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>OK, so the title isn‚Äôt entirely true (I have maintained quite a few blogs in my day). But, one thing is for sure, I have sucked at blogging <strong>lately</strong>. So much so, I just had to think hard about having to bold lately using markdown in the previous sentence <em>#meta</em>.</p>
<h4 id="burnout">Burnout</h4>
<p>I was blogging very consistently for the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a> on their <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com">Mobile Tuts Plus</a> as well as on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a> and here. Eventually, I got burnt out and gave up blogging on every blog (for the month).</p>
<p>What happened was, I was blogging to make money (Envato pays $250/post!) and no longer for fun. This sucks and I was missing deadlines and writing crappy content which needed much revision.</p>
<h4 id="new-plan">New Plan</h4>
<p>Write here only (for fun!) and infrequently on icode if time permits as I can do that during work time üòâ That being said, expect to see more content here for better or worse. Once a week is the new goal.</p>
<h4 id="shutup">Shutup</h4>
<p>That‚Äôs what you are saying to me. I hate these ‚ÄúSorry I haven‚Äôt been around in a while. I promise to post more‚Äù posts that are usually the last posts on a blog for like 5 years just as much as you do. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs not the case here. You will just have to trust me and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I have a sweet new theme from <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn‚Äôt until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.</p>
<p>Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing <a href="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/">Vim has been ported to iOS</a>. I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!</p>
<img src="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/overview.jpg?13270539" width="400" />
<p>It has <em>most</em> of the major Vim features and commands including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic indentation</li>
<li>Visual mode (block operations)</li>
<li>Language-aware syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities</li>
<li>Macros recording and playback</li>
<li>Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)</li>
<li>Multiple clipboards</li>
</ul>
<p>You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.</p>
<p>There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dropbox Support ‚Äì Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.</li>
<li>Keyboard bar ‚Äì Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( ‚Äú:‚Äù ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.</li>
<li>Plugin support ‚Äì This is an Apple limitation <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>NERDTree ‚Äì The file browser that‚Äôs built in doesn‚Äôt work too well.</li>
</ol>
<p>With Vim mobile, you can now look <em>even more</em> nerdy on your iPhone üòâ</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2012/01/19/fluid-for-mac/">Fluid For Mac</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get ‚Äúnative web apps‚Äù that have icons and are launchable?‚Äù.</p>
<p>After a quick Google search, I realized <strong><a href="http://fluidapp.com/">this already exists!</a></strong>. The app is called Fluid and it does an incredible job of what I described above and more.</p>
<img src="http://fluidapp.com/images/dock_large.png" width="400" />
<p>Here are the feature highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a ‚Äúnative‚Äù Mac app for any web app</li>
<li>Custom icon for each ‚Äúnative‚Äù app you create</li>
<li>Full screen mode</li>
<li>User scripps. These are my favorite. They allow you to update the badge count based on information in the browser. See below for a sample user script.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample User Script For Twitter</strong></p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôjavascript‚Äô>(function () {
        if (window.fluid) {
            setInterval(function updateBadge() {
                var counts = /\d+/.exec(document.title);
                if (counts && counts[0] &gt; 0) {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = counts[0] &gt; 99 ? ‚Äò99+‚Äô : counts[0];
                } else {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = ‚Äù;
                }
            }, 2000);
        }
    })();&lt;/code></pre>
</div>
<p><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/88425">Source</a></p>
<p>Fluid is free with some minimal features, but I urge you to drop the $4.99 to gain full screen mode and user scripts. It‚Äôs well worth it. I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a happy customer.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>tl;dr; Don‚Äôt buy a Kindle Fire for your kid until they resolve the parental control issues. Wifi password protection is their current solution, and it sucks.</p>
<p>Like many parents, I thought it would be a good idea to get a tablet device for my son so that he could play some <em>educational</em> games and watch some Netflix (in moderation of course). After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire. Before the Apple fanboys give me crap, know that I am one, I have an iPad, it‚Äôs too expensive for my son.</p>
<p>Honestly, I really love the fire. I think it has the <em>least terrible</em> Android interface of any of the devices. It‚Äôs intuitive and my 3 year old was able to grasp navigation right away. In addition to navigation, he quickly figured out how to acquire new content (apps, video, children‚Äôs books) thanks to Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne-Click Ordering‚Äù. Obviously, Amazon thought the process they use on the web transfered well to a tablet device and was not willing to compromise on that. That‚Äôs neither here nor there. You can find plenty of posts about user‚Äôs complaining about the <strong>initial</strong> lack of parental controls.</p>
<h4 id="the-update">The Update</h4>
<p>Shortly after receiving some pretty rough reviews for their interface, Amazon rolled out their first update which brought us to 6.2.1. In addition to fixing some of there terribly choppy UI, they rolled out their ‚Äúfix‚Äù for the lack of parental controls.</p>
<p>I noticed a new security setting that I had hoped would allow the device to require a password for content purchase, but it turns out the setting is to password protect enabling wifi.</p>
<p><strong>Password protect enabling wifi? Really?</strong></p>
<p>This is laughable at best. What a worthless feature. I could not figure out why anyone would ever want that. And then I had a conversation with ‚Äútech support‚Äù.</p>
<h4 id="their-8220solution8221-confirmed">Their ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù Confirmed</h4>
<p>After seeing an email from Amazon the other day showing my purchase for $17.99 for Team Umizoomi Season 1 (whatever the crap that is), which obviously my son purchased, I set out to chat with customer support. The conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Refund!? No parental controls!</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Enable Wifi Password = protection!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> No, watch Netflix! Browse Web! Stupid Solution</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Yes Netflix Need Wifi. Did I solve your problem?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> ?</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Phone Number. Call Video Support</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. Amazon actually pushes this as their solution to the lack of parental controls. My suspicions were confirmed by Outsourced Guy.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs sad that a huge company such as Amazon feels that <em>their process</em> is more important than listening to their customers. Although their devices have been selling like <em>fire</em> (badum ch!), they need to address such gaping issues if they are to maintain their edge in the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù tablet space. Especially as the younger generations start embracing the technology.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/">WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again</a> made it to the front page of Hacker News. I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my WordPress install.</p>
<p>At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we‚Äôll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the influx of HN traffic crashed the server multiple times and I was (with good reason) mocked in the comments (‚Äúmust be because he‚Äôs ‚Äòback to WordPress‚Äô‚Äù). So, I asked for advice and further ‚Äúbeefed up‚Äù my setup switching from Apache to Nginx, upping the ram, and switching caching plugins. WordPress is a beast and hard to optimize. That‚Äôs not even the kicker as to why I switched away.</p>
<h4 id="a-call-from-rackspace8230">A Call From Rackspace‚Ä¶</h4>
<p>About a month ago, I realized my blog was down. I figured that it might have been that I was featured somewhere else which was crashing it (again I was rolling my eyes at WordPress). But then, I got a call and email from a <em>very</em> helpful Rackspace employee. The email went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the very best efforts of or our Engineering and Datacenter Operations Teams, unfortunately the host machine that your cloud server ‚ÄòWebsites‚Äô resides on was not able to be recovered. At this point, we are looking at complete data loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and‚Ä¶ Rackspace, in this poorly phrased email, was basically like. ‚ÄúWell, sucks to be you, hope you had a backup!‚Äù. Well, I admit this is partially my fault for not having a backup as I am a bit of a n00b when it comes to server admin, but I had been hosting for years on (don‚Äôt judge me) GoDaddy before that and a couple years on Rackspace. I had no idea that hosting companies didn‚Äôt have backups of their own. It would seem that this might be crucial to their business.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I lost everything including a jewelry site that I ran (not many sales), an iPhone leaderboard site (not very popular), 2 of my buddies WordPress blogs, and my current WordPress blog.</p>
<h4 id="jekyll-to-the-rescue">Jekyll To The Rescue</h4>
<p>I was pretty angry at Rackspace and myself for never making a backup, but then it hit me that <em>most</em> of my posts had been converted to Jekyll and were backed up in a github repository. I was able to restore my blog within a few minutes (now hosted on GitHub) and recover the WordPress posts from the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">Feedburner cache</a> of my site.</p>
<p>As for my buddies‚Äô sites‚Ä¶ I feel for them <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h4 id="new-list-of-why-jekyll-is-awesome">New List Of Why Jekyll Is Awesome</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatically backed up</strong> ‚Äì This is huge. If not for switching to Jekyll at one point, I would have lost <strong>years</strong> worth of content. If you have every tried to back up WordPress, it‚Äôs a huge frackin pain since the database dump usually gets HUGE.</li>
<li><strong>Free To Host</strong> ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure why I was so stubborn about doing my own hosting. I am now hosting on <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> and it couldn‚Äôt be more stable and fast.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Blogging</strong> ‚Äì This was my largest gripe about Jekyll. I was jealous that I couldn‚Äôt blog from my iPhone like WordPress users. Well, I have found a pretty decent solution (tutorial to follow), which involves a combo of Prompt, Screen, and Vim.</li>
<li><strong>Content Oriented</strong> ‚Äì WordPress makes it super easy to dump tons of images into your posts. While blogging with Jekyll (inside of Vim in my case), it‚Äôs a little bit more of a pain to add your own images. That being said you must be choosy forcing you to focus more on the content and less on using visual crutches.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Anywhere</strong> ‚Äì This was another limitation I was placing on Jekyll in my last post. However, I just wasn‚Äôt using Jekyll to its full potential. I was building my site locally and rsyncing it up to my server. This process was a little tedious and discouraged me from writing many new posts. Now, hosting with github, posting is as simple as a quick push to the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Fast</strong> ‚Äì This one should be obvious.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I am quite happy blogging with Jekyll. As far as I‚Äôm concerned there is no reason to ever host my own blog again (as long as Github doesn‚Äôt ditch pages üòâ ). Also, if you currently have stuff on Rackspace, <strong>go make a backup now</strong> (or ditch them altogether). Thanks for reading and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">look out</a> for my next post about mobile blogging with Jekyll.</p>
<p>Happy Blogging!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.</p>
<p>I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my ‚Äúblog engine‚Äù</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wptux.com/206/wp-typo">The WPTypo WordPress Theme</a> I ported this to Jekyll</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> for hosting (it‚Äôs free).</li>
<li>Vim ‚Äì I‚Äôm using this as my ‚Äúblog editor‚Äù. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is <strong>always</strong> backed up and easily accessible.</p>
<p>2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a>, I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a>. You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-caterpillar-game-with-cocos2d/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn‚Äôt really lend itself to visuals ;).</p>
<p>Happy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!</p>

  <section class="post-body">
	<p>From the first time I saw this effect in the Tweetie (now <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter for iPhone</a>), I was crazy about it. I had written my own hacks to make something <em>close</em>, but it was always terrible. Within the past few months, I have been using a perfect/elegant solution to this problem called <a href="https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD">SVProgressHUD</a>.</p></p>

<p>Using this in your project is as easy as calling:</p>
