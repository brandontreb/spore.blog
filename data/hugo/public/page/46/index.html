  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p><strong>tl;dr Present yourself to potential clients as if you have already made it. Don’t be scared, the work it out there. Freelancing FTW!1!</strong></p>
<p>In the first week of December, I got a rather unfortunate (and unexpected) call from the CEO of the company I was working for. The gist of it was “we are reorganizing, and have decided to cut your position. Effective Immediately”. At this point, I was the Director Of Mobile Engineering and was making a very decent salary. While I was planning on leaving to go freelance at some point, I hadn’t dreamed it would be this sudden.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that CEO did me one of the biggest favors of my life. He forced me to go indie. I probably would have flailed there for at least another year before even considering moving on.</p>
<p>I want to share a few things (good and bad) about what I have learned in the past month and how I will never (willingly) work for a company again.</p>
<h2 id="panic-sets-in">Panic Sets In</h2>
<p>I had been working at the aforementioned company for the past 4 years. In fact, it was my first job out of college. So, you can imagine how scary and stressful it was going from a steady paycheck to nothing in the blink of an eye. What’s ironic about this is, many people I have talked to since going indie have told me that they wish they could do it too, but really like the “security” of their corporate job.</p>
<p>At first, I freaked out a little and took the day off (I was “let go” in the morning). But, the very next day I hit the ground running in search of a contract.</p>
<h2 id="contracts-contracts-everywhere">Contracts, Contracts Everywhere</h2>
<p>Much to my surprise, there are contracting opportunities <strong>everywhere</strong>. Again, I had to leave the company so soon, I hadn’t had time to research this myself beforehand. A simple Google search of “[your field] contract work” should reveal plenty (assuming your field is some sort of software. I can’t speak for other industries). I even started applying for salaried jobs as a contractor. You would be surprised how many companies are open to it.</p>
<p>This was immediately comforting.</p>
<h2 id="talk-the-talk">Talk The Talk</h2>
<p>My first few days of looking for a contract were pretty interesting. Being that I had just been let go, I felt this intense pressure to land a contract right away. This definitely came through in how I related to the recruiters and people I spoke with. My good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/slcaruso">Scott Caruso</a> sat down with me and gave me some of the most important advice I would hear for dealing with potential clients.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are looking for the “right opportunity”. If you are considering freelance, you obviously feel you are an expert (or close to) in your field and that definitely has value. Don’t settle for crappy contracts at crappy rates just because you need the money. You will hate life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spam! During my first week, I would contact one or two people and they said they would get back to me. Well, I didn’t want to possibly have to tell them no later, so I would politely not communicate with anyone else until I heard back. That was dumb.<br>
Finding contracts is like shopping at Goodwill. It’s mostly crap, but if you go through enough of the crap, you will find a gem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage your existing contacts. This should be obvious. I was holding off on this early on as I didn’t want to sound lame. However, these are the people you can show a little desperation to as they are (or should be) your friends. That being said, someone always knows someone else that needs some work done. If I hadn’t done this, I for sure would have violated #1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are a scarce resource (at least present yourself that way): Once I started telling recruiters that I was talking to tons of others and am planning on making a deal this week, I started getting a flood of them calling me back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<ol>
<li>Everything you do starts to get a price tag. The other day, I asked my wife to <a href="http://xkcd.com/149/">make me a sandwichh</a>. She told me to make it myself, and I politely informed her that the 15 minutes spent doing that would cost us $25 so it had better be the best sandwhich I have ever made.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>I am not sure if this feeling ever goes away (if you are a veteran freelance, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your thoughts).
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>It’s a little scary knowing you don’t have a paycheck in X months (X being your current contract length). This was the most frightening thing at first. Now, it seems like an exciting challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tendency to overwork: Since you now have money++ and can make more just by adding hours, you will be drawn to work more. I have talked to many others who end up leaving freelance because of burnout from working too much. Sure you made $30K in 2 weeks, but you are hating life.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>So far my journey as an independent iOS developer has been incredible. I am loving every minute of it and I encourage anyone interested in it to do the same. I don’t think it’s for the n00b or the non-self starter. <a href="http://www.jamiebegin.com/how-to-become-a-successful-freelance-web-developer-and-not-kill-your-career/">This post</a> I found on Hacker News has a brilliant step by step tutorial on moving in this direction.</p>
<p>I hope you have enjoyed yet another post on freelancing.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As I mature as a developer, I try to rely on other people’s code more an more. Why build something from scratch when a solution already exists that you can fit in your project. In <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-mud-pro/id511678455?mt=8">Pocket MUD Pro</a>, I used <strong>13</strong> 3rd party libraries and am using quite a bit more in the project that I’m currently working on. I figured that I would share some of the libraries that I have been using so that it might save you some time in the future.</p>
<h2 id="1-cocoaasyncsocket">1. CocoaAsyncSocket</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket">https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket</a></p>
<p>Many of my applications involve TCP or UDP networking. There is a lot of boiler plate code involved in every networked application, and CocoaAsyncSocket solves much of that for you.</p>
<h2 id="2-appirater">2. Appirater</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://github.com/arashpayan/appirater/">http://github.com/arashpayan/appirater/</a></p>
<p><img src="http://arashpayan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/AppiraterScreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>Hopefully, you have heard of this one or a similar library by now. It’s very challenging to get users to want to review your applications, let alone give you a positive review. AppiRater allows you to prompt a user to rate your application based on either number of launches or “significant events” which you specify.</p>
<h2 id="3-zip-archive">3. Zip Archive</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ziparchive/">http://code.google.com/p/ziparchive/</a></p>
<p>I try to ship small applications that download assets upon launch. A good way to send these assets over the wire is to zip them up and stick them on your server. I have written an article about this on <a href="http://www.icodeblog.com/2012/08/13/unzipping-files-using-zip-archive/">iCodeBlog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="4-quick-dialog">4. Quick Dialog</h2>
<p>**Link: ** <a href="https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog">https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog</a></p>
<p>Creating forms in iOS is pretty painful. It usually involves custom table cells and a lot of delegate nonsense. QuickDialog takes away some of this pain and allows you to easily create iOS forms. You can even design them using JSON.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog/raw/master/other/quickdialog2.png" alt="QuickDialog Screenshot"></p>
<h2 id="5-tsminiwebbrowser">5. TSMiniWebBrowser</h2>
<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/tonisalae/TSMiniWebBrowser">https://github.com/tonisalae/TSMiniWebBrowser</a></p>
<p>Often times, you want a quick and dirty browser in your application. I generally use it to point to in-app documentation or take the user to a page after tapping on a link. It’s quick and easy.</p>
<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/1cae2dfc9160aa6a8e0583d0682d78462c97d60f/687474703a2f2f646c2e64726f70626f782e636f6d2f752f373630343232322f4769744875622f54534d696e6957656242726f777365722f73686f745f30315f7468756d622e706e67" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>I hope you find some value in this list. I’d love to hear about the libraries <strong>you</strong> use frequently.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

	<p><strong>Fix the Snooze button</strong>! I have no idea how this UI component got to Apple’s review team and they were like ”<em>Yep, that looks beautiful! Ship it!</em>”. If Apple changes the snooze button and slaps a 6 on iOS, I will be happy. If not, more rants to follow. Stay tuned….</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2012/05/29/lua-scripting-the-ui-for-pocket-mud-pro/">Lua Scripting The UI For Pocket MUD Pro</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I have just updated my MUD client [<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-mud-pro/id511678455?mt=8">Pocket MUD Pro</a>] to be a universal library. It was surprisingly easy to add the iPad support as most of the application was comprised of UITableViews.</p>
<p>The main “MUD” view was the most challenging part as it contains a couple UIWebViews, UIButons, and a UITextField. However, I chose to do something I feel is pretty cool.</p>
<h4 id="scripting-the-ui-with-lua">Scripting The UI With Lua</h4>
<p>If I haven’t said it enough, I love lua. Especially in the context of scripting within other applications. Pocket MUD Pro already has complete lua support in triggers in aliases, so I figured I might as well apply that same logic to the UI.</p>
<p>Pocket MUD Pro has 3 core sections for the UI not counting the text input field. The main view (UIWebview), the prompt view (UIWebview), and the button bar (custom UIView).</p>
<p>One of the core challenges I faced on the iPhone, was resizing/reorienting all of these views on orientation change as well as when the keyboard was visible and when it wasn’t. To be honest, I spent most of my cycles getting this part right. On the iPad, I decided to things a little differently which improved the speed of my development overall and paved the way for future updates that will allow user-scripted UIs.</p>
<h4 id="the-ui-script">The UI Script</h4>
<p>I want to start by showing you the lua code that is used to script the UI by default.</p>
<div>
  <pre><code class="’lua’">–MUD 
mudFrame = Frame:new(&quot;mud_frame&quot;) 
mudFrame.type = FrameTypeMUD
mudFrame.portraitFrame = {0,0,768,931}
mudFrame.portraitFrameKeyboard = {0,0,768,667}
mudFrame.landscapeFrame = {0,0,1024,675}
mudFrame.landscapeFrameKeyboard = {0,0,1024,323}
createFrame(mudFrame)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>What’s happening here is, I have created a Frame class that has some properties (type, name, etc…) and injected it into the global lua space for use inside of the UIScripts. Then when the interface gets drawn, I reference the UI script for each of the MUD servers and use it to render the interface.</p>
<p>One interesting thing here is, I set the frames for each of the possible layout scenarios. Portrait, Landscape, with and without the keyboard. That way, when the keyboard hides/dismisses or the user rotates the device, I just reference the this script again and re-render the frame accordingly. This could have been achieved with auto-resizing masks however, it gets much more complex and things get tricky when you want to have a dynamic number of windows.</p>
<p>I follow this exact pattern for the button frames and the prompt frames. As you might have guessed, in a future release, I will open this script area up to MUDders and give the user the ability to script the interface however they would like. Some examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated map window</li>
<li>Dedicated chat window</li>
<li>Customized movement buttons</li>
<li>Customized backgrounds/borders/themes</li>
<li>Custom health/status/mana</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this powerful UI Scripting style, a user will be able to create complex interfaces such as the one below from inside the app:</p>
<img class="alignnone" title="Achaea" alt="" src="http://img.brothersoft.com/screenshots/softimage/a/achaea-300819-1263188763.jpeg" width="450" />
<p>I still have a ways to go with exposing various functionalities via my custom lua bridge. But things seem to be moving along quite smoothly.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how I was able to bridge lua into my application, consider checking out my talk on lua scripting at <a href="http://360idev.com/">360iDev 2012</a> later this year!</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

This is especially good news for me as I can now continue development on my jailbroken app for the <a href="http://getinpulse.com" title="" target="">inPulse</a> watch, <a href="http://www.myrepospace.com/profile/brandontreb/140058/inPulse" title="" target="">iOS notifier</a>. </p>

	<p>I mentioned this on Twitter last week, so I might as well post it here to make it <em>more</em> official. My talk <strong>Making Your Games More Dynamic With Lua Scripting</strong> was accepted for <a href="http://360idev.com/">360iDev 2012</a>! This will be my first official speaking engagement and I could not be more excited/nervous.</p>
<h4 id="the-talk">The Talk</h4>
<p>I have had a huge interest in lua for some time now, especially as it applies to scripting games. In my last project, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-mud-pro/id511678455?mt=8">Pocket MUD Pro</a>, I even embedded lua 5.1 and created my own bridge in order to allow players to fully script the gameplay. This got me very excited for the future as it was so easy to get lua up and running.</p>
<p>My talk will cover the basics of setting lua up in your own iOS projects. I will be using a simple tile based RPG (written in Cocos2D) for the demo and will demonstrate how you might use lua to script the behaviors of the NPCs as well as dynamically add new ones to the game. This opens up a whole world of possibility as you can now ship code over the wire and modify your game content without ever submitting an update to Apple.</p>
<p>It appears my talk has some pretty steep competition in its timeslot. There are two other incredible talks going on at the same time, so I’m starting to campaign for it now <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Please comment on this post if you plan on attending 360iDev. I would love to connect with you.</p>

<p>We believe that developers should have the freedom to price their games how they like, without interference from the online stores that sell the games. Why? Because it allows us to promote our games more freely, as we are doing here! We rely on the ability to promote our games for our livelihood and control over pricing is an important tool for this purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because We May is doing something very incredible here. They are a website to help you promote your game by listing it on sale. Any developer can submit their game(s) as long as they put it on sale for the given duration (May 24-June 1). There are currently some amazing games on sale including Osmos, Super Brothers, World Of Goo HD, and more.</p>
