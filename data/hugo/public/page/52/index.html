	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2010/12/30/image.jpeg/">What Does Your Workspace Look Like?</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I am always very fascinated with the workspaces of others and frequently check out Lifehacker’s posts on their <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-workspace/">featured workspaces</a>. So, for this iDevBlogADay post, I thought I would keep it short and simple with a request. I want to see (and I’m sure others do too) photos of YOUR workspaces (especially those of you with s<a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/my-standing-desk-experiment">tanding desks</a>).</p>
<p>Seeing someone’s work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.</p>
<p>So, I’ll start by sharing a photo of my current workspace. This is where the magic happens…</p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1341" title="image" src="/uploads/2010/image.jpeg" alt="" width="548" height="409" />
<p>Within my workspace, you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macbook Pro</li>
<li>24” Apple LED Display</li>
<li>iPad with Kensington Keyboard Case</li>
<li>Logitec Speakers</li>
<li>“Just Like Jesus” Daily Devotional</li>
<li>Embark (Target Brand) Fitness Ball</li>
<li>Apple wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse</li>
<li>Bonsai Tree (coming soon <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have, this is my workspace. Please post a link to your workspace photos or email them to brandontreb [at] gmail [dot] com and I will append them to this post. I can’t wait!</p>
<p>Update: Here are some workspaces submitted by readers so far:</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2010/12/28/free.jpeg/">Free App Per Day Service</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" title="free" src="/uploads/2010/free.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />
</p>
<p>As many of you may know, I created a site called <a href="http://freshapps.com">Fresh Apps</a>. This site started as sort of a Digg for developer submitted iPhone apps. Since then, we have added plenty of new features and have grown a community of over 10,000 iPhone users.</p>
<p>Recently, I have noticed a few services sprout up that basically have a schedule of apps that shift from paid to free for a given day. The most notable being <a href="http://freeappaday.com">Free App A Day</a>.</p>
<p>After doing some research, sites such as these are charging a significant amount of money (I have heard up to $10,000) for a 1 day feature.</p>
<p>So, I was curious, given our user base, what do you (fellow iOS) developers think of FreshApps offering a similar service? If we did offer a similar service, here are some questions I have (and would love your feedback).</p>
<ol>
<li>How would you change existing services? What new features would you like to see? what features are worthless?</li>
<li>How much would you pay for such a feature?</li>
<li>Would you be interested in having your app featured the first month for a minimal cost ($1 or so)?</li>
<li>Would you use an iPhone app that lists the upcoming paid to free apps?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you all so much for your feedback. I’m just in the brainstorming time of this, but I will totally keep you up to date if anything comes of it.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"><img class="alignleft" title="Standard Theme" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/themes/StandardTheme_20/screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I seem to change my WordPress theme more often than I change my socks. I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.</p>
<p>After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<a href="http://brownbishop.com">http://brownbishop.com</a>), I fell in love with the<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"> Standard WordPress Theme</a>. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it’s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.</p>
<p>So, I urge you to <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302">check it out</a>, It’s kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2010/12/23/dali-clock.jpeg/">Changing Your Life In 2011</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>For this blog post, I decided to take a small break from my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-%E2%80%93-part-3-publishing-tweets/">Twitter Client for Mac</a> tutorial series and discuss something a little more useful 😉 . I felt that a fitness post would be most appropriate around this time of year as all of our “Geek Guts” begin expanding.</p>
<h4 id="my-fitness-story">My Fitness Story</h4>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/geek-gut.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1306" title="geek-gut" src="/uploads/2010/geek-gut.png" alt="" width="256" height="352" /></a>It’s December 23rd and as we gear up for Christmas, we are also compiling our New Year’s resolutions. And I’m sure that on most people’s (especially us computer geeks) lists is something related to weight and a healthy lifestyle. So, I wanted to discuss a little bit about how I made fitness a priority in 2010 and how you can too in 2011.</p>
<p>I began my fitness journey at the beginning of 2010 where I weighed in at 185 lbs and had 19% body fat. Now, I am in not way saying that I was a thick dude. I have been blessed with a stellar metabolism, but I definitely didn’t look “in shape”. More importantly I didn’t have a clue about living a healthy life style. Being a geek, I sat for hours at my desk every day, eating quick foods and drinking soda.</p>
<p>One night, I saw a commercial for the fitness program P90X and was actually very intrigued. Don’t worry, I’m not including any affiliate links or things of that sort, so please don’t think I’m trying to sell you on something. Needless to say, I went on YouTube to find out just how legit this program was. After some browsing, I was quite impressed and inspired. It seemed that after 3 short months (seriously no time), people had changed their entire life around in terms of health and fitness.</p>
<p>So, I did what any geek would do and took a visit to the <em>Bay</em> and acquired a copy from some <em>Pirates</em>. After checking out the program for a week or so, I was hooked and decided to go legit and purchase a copy. Within 3 months, I began to absolutely LOVE exercising, in fact I became a little addicted to it :/ . I learned how to track what foods I was intaking as well as replaced much of the crappy liquids I was drinking with water.</p>
<p>After completion of the program, I was down to 163lbs with a 12% body fat and have been exercising since. I’m not posting photos because I feel that would be in bad taste. Check out others on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=p90x&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p>Now, this is a really lengthy intro (kind of sounds spammy too, sorry), but the point is, it’s not hard to get into a healthy routine. I have talked to tons of people about my “transformation” (I hate this term), and almost every person asks me how I got started. Everyone either feels that it’s too late for them, or they will start ‘tomorrow’. So, here is a formula for you lazy geeks (I can call you that because that’s what I was last year :))</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a copy of P90X. Again, I’m not a P90X salesmen, Pirate a copy if you have to. Just get one! If you want to buy it, it’s about the cost of 3 months of the gym, which coincidentally is the length of the program (90 days) $120</li>
<li>Buy a resistance band – These are everywhere (target, walmart, big 5, etc…) – $20</li>
<li>Buy a pull-up bar – $30</li>
<li>Quit stalling – Start this Monday and let me know how it goes <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this is just the beginning. The biggest problem with diets/fitness programs/etc is people don’t look at them as a lifestyle change, they see them as temporary. People say crap like “I want to be XYZlbs or fit into a size J”. Don’t do that! Sure these are nice goals to have, but DONT MAKE THEM THE REASON YOU EXERCISE AND EAT HEALTHY. If you do, you are just setting yourself up to fail. Exercise and don’t eat crap because you want to be healthy. Do it because you are sick of being tired and lethargic all the time.</p>
<h4 id="i-don8217t-have-time-to-exercise">I don’t have time to exercise</h4>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/dali-clock.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1308" title="dali-clock" src="/uploads/2010/dali-clock.jpeg" alt="" width="196" height="196" /></a>Of course you would say that… I did too. That’s why I love P90X. It’s only 1 hour a day and within that hour, you are told exactly what to do. I always felt that to exercise, I had to spend hours in the gym, running, lifting, blah blah… No, one hour a day. I spend that reading Reddit. Get up an hour earlier, go to bed an hour later. Stop eating on your lunch break and exercise then. You can always eat at your desk when you get back.</p>
<h4 id="staying-motivated">Staying Motivated</h4>
<p>So, you have decided that 2011 is going to be your year; you are going to get in shape. Here are a few tips to help you stay motivated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn, learn, learn – Just as you spend time learning about new programming languages, or reading about yet another tablet device. Learn about new things to eat, new exercises to try, new goals. Whatever, just maintain the excitement by learning new things.</li>
<li>Get others involved – This generally comes naturally. When others see you getting into shape, they will most likely want to join. This can be a great motivator, especially when you are feeling burnt out. Get a workout buddy to go to the gym, run, do P90x, etc… with.</li>
<li>Find healthy things to consume that don’t suck – This is a huge challenge for people starting out. They think that they have to eat celery and chicken breasts all day. This is one thing I love about p90x. It comes with an incredibly (and delicious) diet plan including recipes. In a future post, I’m going to write about a stellar protein smoothie that I have every day.</li>
<li>Get the crap out of your house – I’m serious, you won’t miss it. Cookies, Soda, Doughnuts, whatever…</li>
<li>If you want soda, drink a soda – A can of soda is roughly 120 calories, this isn’t terrible. But don’t make it a habbit. Limit yourself and throw away your effin Big Gulp cup!</li>
<li>Eat before you leave your house – this is huge. If you are hungry and you are out, what do you do? You go scoop up a McFeeces from McDonalds… Instead, eat some lunch meat or whatever before you go run those errands.</li>
<li>Eat frequently with smaller portions – I told my dad that I eat about 5-7 times a day, and he responded with “you’re going to get fat doing that” Contrary to popular belief, it is far better for you to eat more frequent, smaller meals. This is tricky when you spend the day in the office. You have to somewhat plan your day in terms of food. Bring stuff to snack on such as nuts, popcorn, protein bars, and beef jerkey.</li>
<li>Share your success – Blog, Tweet, Facebook, Youtube. Whatever it is, tell people about it. Others will surely praise you for this, and you will most likely motivate them. Plus, it will hold you accountable.</li>
<li>Get a good water bottle and take it everywhere – Water is a tricky thing. It’s so hard to remember to drink enough. I have found that if I have water in front of me, I will always sip on it, especially when I’m sitting at my desk all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>To wrap this up, I’m not trying to sell you on P90X or any other fitness program. I just feel that it will be a killer start and give you all of the tools needed to launch into a healthier, more fit 2011. Also, you will start seeing results very quickly.</p>

</p>
<p>My wife has this interesting problem of having vivid dreams about whatever she was last watching/discussing before bed. Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.</p>
<p>Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming. He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed. My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice “Does he have a memory leak?”</p>
<p>I laughed so hard it woke her up. I then appropriately responded with “I have to go take a memory leak”.</p>

<p>I found this article while browsing reddit and was blown away. I have been a little mystified at the potential algorithms used by notch to render the terrain in Minecraft.</p>
<p>This provides a killer explanation of some interesting algorithms that can be used to generate such worlds. It also contains the source code that you can download and play with.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>With the upcoming release of the Mac App Store, I can only imagine another gold rush is upon us. Clever Indie developers making money hand over fist while the store as well as developers find their identities. With that being said, I feel that there is a serious lack of interesting (maintained) Twitter clients for OSX. I say “maintained” because Tweetie for OSX is just fantastic, however Twitter said they don’t have any plans for it at this time. So, I want to provide devs with the tools to create an amazing Twitter client for the Mac that I will want to use <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Quite some time ago, I began (and never completed) a series on <a href="http://brandontreb.com/objective-c-programming-tutorial-creating-a-twitter-client-part-1/">writing a Twitter client for OSX</a>. It was very well received by the development community, however once Twitter switched over to OAUTH, I became too lazy to update it <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . So, I figured a tutorial series for <a href="http://idevblogaday">#iDevBlogADay</a> would be the perfect opportunity to complete it.</p>
<p>So we are going to start from the ground up. In today’s tutorial, we are going walk through getting the initial resources and setting up Twitter to authenticate our application. We will also post a basic tweet.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-twitter">Setting Up Twitter</h4>
<p>In order for your application to interface with Twitter, you must register it with them over at <a href="http://developer.twitter.com">http://developer.twitter.com</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://developer.twitter.com">http://developer.twitter.com</a> and sign up if needed</li>
<li>Click on <a href="http://developer.twitter.com/apps">Your Apps</a></li>
<li>Click <a href="http://developer.twitter.com/apps/new">Register A New App</a> and fill out all of the information about your client</li>
<li>You’re all set!</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="getting-necessary-resources">Getting Necessary Resources</h4>
<p>I spent a bit of time researching the various options for handling OAUTH and all of the fun stuff that goes along with Twitter integration and found that <a href="https://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine/">MGTwitterEngine</a> was the least painful to implement. I say least painful because it has a few quirks of it’s own along with not having the best documentation in the world.</p>
<p>So after battling for a bit to get the thing compiled, I have figured out the setup process :). You could also read <a href="https://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine/wiki/Building-and-testing-MGTwitterEngine">Matt’s installation instructions</a>, but I will regurgitate them here a little differently and hopefully be more clear. So here it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have git installed. If not, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">download it for OSX here</a>.</li>
<li>cd to the directory that you want to clone the files to</li>
<li>Clone the MGTwitterEngine repository. Type:<br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine.git</strong></li>
<li>cd into the MGTwitterEngine folder (we will install the dependancies at this level)</li>
<li>Now install the dependancies (<a href="https://github.com/schwa/TouchJSON">TouchJSON</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ctshryock/oauthconsumer">OAUTHConsumer</a>). Note: There is an option to use yajl (yet another json library), but I found it a pain to integrate, so we will just throw it out.<br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/schwa/TouchJSON.git</strong><br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/ctshryock/oauthconsumer.git</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Altogether, this is the order of commands you should have:</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’>$ cd ~/Desktop
$ git clone git://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine.git
$ cd MGTwitterEngine
$ git clone git://github.com/schwa/TouchJSON.git
$ git clone git://github.com/ctshryock/oauthconsumer.git&lt;/code></pre>
</div>
<h4 id="building-mgtwitterengine-what-a-freakin-pain">Building MGTwitterEngine (What a freakin pain)</h4>
<p>I find it interesting that this project is riddled with errors directly upon download. So much work went into it, yet it’s so challenging to get working.</p>
<p>Now open up MGTwitterEngine.xcodeproj. You will notice that there are quite a few missing files (they show in red). That’s fine. DELETE THEM ALL…</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the <strong>yajl</strong> group with everything in it</li>
<li>Delete the <strong>Twitter YAJL Parsers</strong> group and everything in it</li>
<li>Delete <strong>OAToken_KeychainExtensions.m</strong> and <strong>OAToken_KeychainExtensions.h</strong> (they are not used)</li>
<li>Delete <strong>CJSONDataSerializer.h</strong> and <strong>CJSONDataSerializer.m</strong></li>
<li>Delete <strong>CSerializedJSONData.h</strong> and <strong>CSerializedJSONData.m</strong></li>
<li>Click the arrow on the OAuthConsumer group and you will notice that the <strong>Crypto</strong> is missing. We still need this group, but it’s in the wrong place. Delete this group and then open up your MGTwitterEngine folder in Finder. Navigate to <strong>MGTwitterEngine-&gt;oauthconsumer</strong>. Drag the <strong>Crypto</strong> folder into your project.</li>
<li>We need to change the C Language Dialect to C99. To do this right click on MGTwitterEngine in XCode and click Get Info. Scroll down to C Language Dialect and click the drop down changing it to C99<br>
<a href="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.22.12-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1097" title="Screen shot 2010-12-02 at 9.22.12 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.22.12-PM.png" alt="" width="474" height="64" /></a></li>
<li>Finally, we need to tell MGTwitterEngine that we want to use TouchJSON instead of yajl. To do this open up <strong>MGTwitterEngineGlobalHeader.h</strong> and set TOUCHJSON_AVAILABLE to 1.</li>
<li>If you still have any hair left at this point, click Build and Run to and check out the output in the Console</li>
<li>If you don’t feel like jumping through all of these hoops you can download my MGTwitterEngine project with all of this fun stuff completed. <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/MGTwitterEngine.zip">Download it here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="testing-mgtwitterengine">Testing MGTwitterEngine</h4>
<p>For today’s tutorial, we will just be displaying our timeline and updating our status using the demo file provided by MGTwitterEngine. In the next tutorial, we will actually be integrating the engine into a new project. So, open up <strong>AppController.m</strong> in the <strong>Demo</strong> group. Matt has given us some nice variables to fill in, in order to make this thing work. Let’s update to applicationDidFinishLaunching method to look like the code below:</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’>- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification
{
        // Put your Twitter username and password here:
        NSString *username = @"brandontreb";
    NSString *consumerKey = @"aKKEsJHTDNsv4xVlMHmMqw";
    NSString *consumerSecret = @"oldpeoplenakedcriscotwister";
<pre><code>    // Create a TwitterEngine and set our login details.
    twitterEngine = [[MGTwitterEngine alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
[twitterEngine setUsesSecureConnection:NO];
[twitterEngine setConsumerKey:consumerKey secret:consumerSecret];
[twitterEngine setUsername:username];

token = [[OAToken alloc] initWithKey:@&quot;16369316-GgqA00WO0poCAj0XAFhJYDDRthVvWMxTnVyKdfWa1&quot;
                              secret:@&quot;StrongEnoughForAManButMadeForAWoman&quot;];
[twitterEngine setAccessToken:token];
[twitterEngine getHomeTimelineSinceID:0 startingAtPage:0 count:20];
</code></pre>
<p>}&lt;/code&gt;</pre></p>
</div>
<p>So obviously I changed my consumer secret and Access Token Secret. You will need to fill this out with your information. Here is how to obtain them.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Key &amp; Consumer Secret</strong></p>
<p>When logged into <a href="http://developer.twitter.com/apps/">http://developer.twitter.com/apps/</a> , click on the application that you created in the first step:</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.51.55-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1101" title="Screen shot 2010-12-02 at 9.51.55 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.51.55-PM.png" alt="" width="322" height="133" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down and you should see the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.50.46-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1102" title="Screen shot 2010-12-02 at 9.50.46 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.50.46-PM.png" alt="" width="399" height="158" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Access Token &amp; Access Token Secret</strong></p>
<p>In the right column, you should see a link titled “My Access Token”. Click on it.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.05-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1103" title="Screen shot 2010-12-02 at 9.52.05 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.05-PM.png" alt="" width="218" height="38" /></a></p>
<p>Now you should see YOUR Access Token and Access Token Secret</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.15-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104" title="Screen shot 2010-12-02 at 9.52.15 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.15-PM.png" alt="" width="444" height="156" /></a></p>
<h4 id="have-fun">Have Fun!</h4>
<p>After you copy the tokens, keys, and secrets into the app, you should be able start making calls to Twitter using the engine. Build and run the application at this point and watch your home timeline get output to the console. One thing I want to point out is we are displaying an NSDictionary. That means MGTwitterEngine did all of the parsing for us (using TouchJSON), which is super rad.</p>
<p>One more thing to try for fun is to update your status. It will even show that you updated it from YOUR application on Twitter. Add the following line and run it again.</p>
<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’>[twitterEngine sendUpdate:@"@brandontreb is a code gangster!  Check out his #iDevBlogADay post on making your own Twitter client here http://bit.ly/gGrZvI"];&lt;/code></pre>
</div>
<p>Well, that does it for today. Join me next week when I will show you how to move the engine into your own project and we will begin displaying tweets in a basic table view.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
