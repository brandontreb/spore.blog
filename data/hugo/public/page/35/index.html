  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a <a href="http://trebventure.com">converted schoolbus</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I had quite a few “bus chores” and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change composting toilet</li>
<li>Fill up propane tanks</li>
<li>Add heat tape to fresh water lines</li>
<li>Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have <em>more</em> chores on the bus than in a traditional home.</p>
<p>Whatever, off to chop wood for my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/trebventure/p/Bj47D7hn2U9/">tiny wood stove</a>&hellip;</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/30/dev-blinders-failing-to/">Dev Blinders - Failing To See Things From A User Perspective</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>The other day, I was having a conversation over Slack with my development team. They were working on a client project (and doing a killer job), and there was a particular UX pattern that seemed very unintuitive to me.  This app was designed by the client, so there was little the dev team could do beyond making suggestions, so they went ahead and implemented it per the spec.</p>
<p>After fiddling around with it for a few minutes, I literally couldn't understand how to complete the particular task and had to ask the team lead for some help.  He assured me that it made sense and offered to walk me through the architecture and data models to help me better understand the flow.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as developers, we understand these super complex systems solely because we architected them. They seem intuitive to us because we know the underlying data structures and algorithms involved.  When we are speaking to other developers about those systems, they usually get it too, because they understand things at a software level.</p>
<p>This doesn't always translate well when it comes to UX design for the end-user.  I believe developers have a bias when looking over the product in which they are creating.  It makes sense to us, so it must to everyone else. I opted to <em>not</em> learn about the underlying code, so that I could better QA the product by removing some of this bias.</p>
<p><strong>The Moral</strong></p>
<p>Next time you are testing your software, have as many people <em>not</em> involved in the project test it as possible. Given them very little context. Watch them use your product. Find out what <em>is</em> intuitive to them and what isn't.  You will be pleasantly surprised and your software will be better for it.</p>

<p>Another solid post from mmm. His blog was one of the first I read that set us on the path of financial freedom and minimalism.</p>
<p>If you don’t already know about him, I’d suggest starting at the beginning and reading through all of his posts.</p>
<p>I promise it will be worth it.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/28/tips-for-starting-your-cs/">Tips For Starting Your CS Career</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>My little brother was recently in town for the holidays. He’s about to graduate from college with a CS degree, so naturally we talked about searching for a job.</p>
<p>I figured I would share the advice I gave to him here in hopes that it might help others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t be discouraged when you get turned down.</strong> Having hired many employees over the years, I have learned that there are <em>so many</em> reasons to not hire a candidate. Much of the time they don’t even have to do with qualifications. In the past, we would just interview with no intention of hiring to test the waters.</li>
<li><strong>Work with recruiters</strong> there is little downside in working with recruiters as a job seeker. Give them tight parameters about what you are looking for (position, location, etc&hellip;) and tell them not to bother you unless there is a match. Often, recruiters will have better “ins” with hiring managers, so your resume won’t get filtered as often by some algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> I almost wrote that in all caps. Attend local meetups, take people out to coffee, and get connected in the local tech scene. Don’t give me that “I don’t live close to tech” nonsense . I live in a suburb of ABQ (not a big tech town) and still managed to build a killer network of tech locals.</li>
<li><strong>Always be searching for a job</strong> (especially if you already have one). Part of your job, is to find a job/a better job (or at least leverage to get paid more in your current) (longer post on this later).</li>
<li><strong>Shoot for the stars, but be ok landing on the moon</strong> This is more for new grads. Landing a job will give you that confidence boost you need to begin your life outside college. So, don’t stress about landing the dream job at Google on day one (by all means apply though). Just take a job and then see the previous bullet point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy job hunting!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/27/no-one-cares-about-your/">No One Cares About Your Clever Code</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks.</p>
<p>We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great&hellip;until it’s time to ship.</p>
<p>I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule.</p>
<p>When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating. The client literally doesn’t care about all that. They just wants to see feature X working.</p>
<p>I love clever code as much as the next developer, but sometimes you’ve got to table your inner CS geek and just ship something that works. Then, refactor later.</p>
