  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Tonight, I'm going to a party for local entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>I was getting ready for the party and thinking about the signals I am sending with every detail I put into my appearance.  How do I want to be perceived? Should I go combover or faux-hawk, slacks or jeans, watch or Fitbit, leather or suit jacket?  All of these decisions don't necessarily paint the picture of Brandon, so much as they paint the picture of who Brandon wants you to believe he is.</p>
<p>While it may seem vain to contemplate on what signals I'm sending, people do the same thing ALL THE TIME without even being conscious of it.  We do this not only in real life, but especially on Social Media.</p>
<p>Seth Godin will often write on <a href="https://seths.blog/2016/07/the-signals-we-send/">sending signals</a>.</p>
<p>He has a great quote from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy helps us understand what will be received, and intent dramatically improves our effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding that you are always sending signals AND having empathy will not only get you further in business (since you can understand the signals you need to send on an individual basis), it will also get you further as a human being.</p>
<p>This also has me wondering. What signals do I send to myself?</p>

	<p>I have really been enjoying listening to <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/">Darknet Diaries</a> lately. It‚Äôs a Podcast about hacks and software security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The show really makes me realize how crappy and insecure most software is. Most importantly, it has gotten me much more security-minded in the software that I build.</p>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt already listening to it, I‚Äôd suggest you <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/">check it out</a>. You will soon put on your tin foil hat like me and start to believe everybody is trying to hack you.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>My wife and I are hard core ‚Äútype-a‚Äù people. I mean, so planned that we send each other calendar invites for date night (don‚Äôt judge what we consider romantic ;)).</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt used to be like this. When I was younger and in college, I was a total scatter brain, a C student by choice.</p>
<p>This all changed the day I was laid off and had to start my own company. Owning a business requires me to pay attention to every detail, every invoice, dev rate, hours budget,etc&hellip; Its exhausting and college Brandon would have been out years ago.</p>
<p>Fortunately (and I can already feel this sounding like a sales pitch), I use <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. It‚Äôs basically a system using only a notebook and pen to organize your life. Think 90‚Äôs style leather day planner.</p>
<p>While I don‚Äôt use every ‚Äúmodule‚Äù that it offers, I use the system to manage todos, notes, long and short term goals, and lists (this blog post title just came from one such list).</p>
<p>So, if you are like I was, I highly recommend bullet journaling. It will change your life for the better (worse?).</p>

	<p>I absolutely <strong>hate</strong> scoping projects.  It's such uninteresting / uninspiring work.</p>
<p>It's ironic because scoping generally translates to work/dollars, so it's a critical part of my business.</p>
<p>Also, I can't outsource this task. I don't trust anyone to do it correctly and accurately</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a <a href="http://trebventure.com">converted schoolbus</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I had quite a few ‚Äúbus chores‚Äù and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change composting toilet</li>
<li>Fill up propane tanks</li>
<li>Add heat tape to fresh water lines</li>
<li>Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have <em>more</em> chores on the bus than in a traditional home.</p>
<p>Whatever, off to chop wood for my <a href="http://www.instagram.com/trebventure/p/Bj47D7hn2U9/">tiny wood stove</a>&hellip;</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/30/dev-blinders-failing-to/">Dev Blinders - Failing To See Things From A User Perspective</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>The other day, I was having a conversation over Slack with my development team. They were working on a client project (and doing a killer job), and there was a particular UX pattern that seemed very unintuitive to me.  This app was designed by the client, so there was little the dev team could do beyond making suggestions, so they went ahead and implemented it per the spec.</p>
<p>After fiddling around with it for a few minutes, I literally couldn't understand how to complete the particular task and had to ask the team lead for some help.  He assured me that it made sense and offered to walk me through the architecture and data models to help me better understand the flow.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as developers, we understand these super complex systems solely because we architected them. They seem intuitive to us because we know the underlying data structures and algorithms involved.  When we are speaking to other developers about those systems, they usually get it too, because they understand things at a software level.</p>
<p>This doesn't always translate well when it comes to UX design for the end-user.  I believe developers have a bias when looking over the product in which they are creating.  It makes sense to us, so it must to everyone else. I opted to <em>not</em> learn about the underlying code, so that I could better QA the product by removing some of this bias.</p>
<p><strong>The Moral</strong></p>
<p>Next time you are testing your software, have as many people <em>not</em> involved in the project test it as possible. Given them very little context. Watch them use your product. Find out what <em>is</em> intuitive to them and what isn't.  You will be pleasantly surprised and your software will be better for it.</p>

<p>Another solid post from mmm. His blog was one of the first I read that set us on the path of financial freedom and minimalism.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt already know about him, I‚Äôd suggest starting at the beginning and reading through all of his posts.</p>
<p>I promise it will be worth it.</p>
