  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks.</p>
<p>We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great&hellip;until it’s time to ship.</p>
<p>I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule.</p>
<p>When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating. The client literally doesn’t care about all that. They just wants to see feature X working.</p>
<p>I love clever code as much as the next developer, but sometimes you’ve got to table your inner CS geek and just ship something that works. Then, refactor later.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>In our house, we often joke that “the diet starts Monday”. Usually, this is in response to some conclusion that we are not currently on the healthiest path.</p>
<p>Procrastination is in our DNA. We put everything off until the absolute last minute. For me, it’s usually side projects. Projects that I know will make some revenue to supplement some of my consulting income. It’s my goal to eventually move on from consulting, however that has been on my “resolution list” for years, with little progress.</p>
<p>I’m committed to finishing one such project before the years up. I should get hacking on it&hellip;on Monday.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/22/gratitude/">Gratitude</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>It’s often much easier to have a sense of gratitude when things are going well. As humans, we are prone to focusing on the one bad thing that’s going wrong rather than the multitude of good things going right. This traces way back to a time where we needed this sense to stay away from danger.</p>
<p>My father-in-law was just admitted to the hospital with lukeumia. Although this is one of the harder times in our family’s lives, it’s really been a sobering experience giving me a stronger sense of gratitude for my wife and kids.</p>
<p>I appreciate them more now than ever and am grateful for their health and spirit.</p>
<p>I wish you and your family blessings today, and pray that you too can always find gratitude, even in tribulation.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/22/prototypes-usually-end-up-in/">Prototypes Usually End Up In Production</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>“Just hack a quick proof of concept, we’ll rebuild it when we get more funding.”  These are some words I often hear from clients who have minimal budgets.</p>
<p>They generally want my team to build something small/quick/cheap to get their concept across in hopes of securing more funds down the road.</p>
<p>What I have learned by saying “yes” to these types of requests in the past is, those quickly hacked prototypes often end up in production.</p>
<p>While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it’s sometimes problematic if we viewed the code as disposable up front. Normally, a client will have you ship a prototype and then will want to quickly iterate. If you are not careful, you will soon accrue technical debt and eventually sour your relationship with the client due to underperforming.</p>
<p>So, if you are ever asked to do a quick prototype, do yourself a favor and treat it as if it will be production-ready from day one. You never know how long you will be supporting it.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/21/cold-emailing-locals/">Cold Emailing Locals</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I always receive cold emails. Some of them are personalized, and some of them are robotic. Sometimes, I’ll ignore and sometimes I’ll respond with something snarky (this is my spiritual gift). I get it. These are just part of the internet.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it’s a different story.  I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in <em>real life</em> and possibly a sale.</p>
<p>These are the emails in which I’ll generally reply with some practical advice.</p>
<p><strong>If you are desiring to cold email people in your area</strong></p>
<p>Rather than emailing “Dear Brandon, I really think your business could benefit from our website services.”, you should <strong>always</strong> do at least 5 seconds of research.</p>
<p>Start by saying “Brandon, I really loved your post on Staying Fit With 3 Kids, I’d love to buy you coffee and pick your brain”. This shows you are interested and care about them at a human level (which you should anyway) and greatly increases the chances of them buying the services you are selling.</p>
<p>At worst, you will have connected with a likeminded individual who could/would potentially refer others to you in the future. At best, you could get all of the above plus a new customer and friend.</p>
<p>So, the next time you are cold emailing someone who’s within driving distance from you, give this post another read and consider a more personal approach.</p>
