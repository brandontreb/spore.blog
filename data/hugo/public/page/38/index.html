  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>“Just hack a quick proof of concept, we’ll rebuild it when we get more funding.”  These are some words I often hear from clients who have minimal budgets.</p>
<p>They generally want my team to build something small/quick/cheap to get their concept across in hopes of securing more funds down the road.</p>
<p>What I have learned by saying “yes” to these types of requests in the past is, those quickly hacked prototypes often end up in production.</p>
<p>While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it’s sometimes problematic if we viewed the code as disposable up front. Normally, a client will have you ship a prototype and then will want to quickly iterate. If you are not careful, you will soon accrue technical debt and eventually sour your relationship with the client due to underperforming.</p>
<p>So, if you are ever asked to do a quick prototype, do yourself a favor and treat it as if it will be production-ready from day one. You never know how long you will be supporting it.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/21/cold-emailing-locals/">Cold Emailing Locals</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I always receive cold emails. Some of them are personalized, and some of them are robotic. Sometimes, I’ll ignore and sometimes I’ll respond with something snarky (this is my spiritual gift). I get it. These are just part of the internet.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it’s a different story.  I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in <em>real life</em> and possibly a sale.</p>
<p>These are the emails in which I’ll generally reply with some practical advice.</p>
<p><strong>If you are desiring to cold email people in your area</strong></p>
<p>Rather than emailing “Dear Brandon, I really think your business could benefit from our website services.”, you should <strong>always</strong> do at least 5 seconds of research.</p>
<p>Start by saying “Brandon, I really loved your post on Staying Fit With 3 Kids, I’d love to buy you coffee and pick your brain”. This shows you are interested and care about them at a human level (which you should anyway) and greatly increases the chances of them buying the services you are selling.</p>
<p>At worst, you will have connected with a likeminded individual who could/would potentially refer others to you in the future. At best, you could get all of the above plus a new customer and friend.</p>
<p>So, the next time you are cold emailing someone who’s within driving distance from you, give this post another read and consider a more personal approach.</p>

	<p>Pretty cool, I just set my Jekyll blog up to receive Web Mentions via <a href="https://webmention.io">webmention.io</a>. Next step: Display m.b replies on the post themselves.  Amazing what you can do with a statically generated site.</p>
<p>OK, I need to stop farting around with this stuff and actually do <em>some</em> work.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/19/blogging-builds-community/">Blogging Builds Community</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>It's been around 3 weeks since I started <a href="http://www.brandontreb.com/on-blogging-more-frequently.html">blogging every weekday</a>.  This experience has been nothing short of delightful.</p>
<p>While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.</p>
<p>When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple's dreaded NDA. I absolutely <strong>loved</strong> the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.  I have been blogging on and off since then and have never felt that same spark.</p>
<p>This all changed, when I made a commitment to writing daily short-form blog posts and posting them to <a href="https://micro.blog/brandontreb">micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandontreb">twitter</a>.  I began to receive comments, and these comments turned into <em>real</em> discussions.</p>
<p>This has been a blast as I'm now able to connect with so many wonderful people in the community.  We are sharing thoughts and ideas and challenging each other’s beliefs on tech, business, etc…</p>
<p>So, I challenge you. If you are on the fence, just stop worrying about the quality/frequency/etc&hellip; of your writing and just write.  And once you have written, share it with others.  I promise you, the community you will build is worth it!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/16/one-thing/">One Thing</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I was recently listening to <a href="https://overcast.fm/+KebuxnetQ">Episode 344- 10 Strategies To Be Happier Through Gratitude</a> on the Tim Ferris Show. Oddly enough, I much prefer episodes where Tim is absent. I do love him, but sometimes feels he steals the conversation.</p>
<p>Anyway, the episode was hosted by a guy named A.J. Jacobs. Jacobs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923">wrote a book on gratitude</a> and is known for traveling the world to thank over 1,000 people involved in his morning coffee (think farmer, roaster, truck driver, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>While I loved the episode, there was something super interesting that I took from it. Jacobs keeps a notebook where he writes down just <em>one thing</em> that he takes away from every book, podcast, and blog.</p>
<p>I love this idea. Often, I will read something, get super inspired, only to forget about it and never apply it.</p>
<p>I feel that this is a great strategy and think it will make for an interesting post on this blog every so often. Think of it as mini book/podcast/blog reviews that highlight what I found to be important.</p>
<p>So my “one thing” from that episode is to start writing down the “one things” from other pieces of media.</p>

	<p>@manton I have to tell you that I really appreciate that the micro.blog iOS app doesn’t “infinite scroll”. The Load More button forces me to pause and decide if I want to keep consuming content. I hope you never change that :)</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandon_swoop.ngrok.io/2018/11/16/starting-new-projects/">Starting New Projects</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I had the amazing opportunity today to hit <strong>File -&gt; New Project</strong> today. There are few feelings in the world as great as the optimism that comes from starting a brand new project.</p>
<p>“This one will be different”, I murmur to myself. “I will keep it clean, organized, and free from hacks. “, I cheerfully gloat.</p>
<p>Why is it that it’s so hard to follow through on this philosophy? I said it <a href="http://www.brandontreb.com/client-deliveries-are-hard.html">yesterday</a>, coding is hard. Requirements change, clients change, and most notibly, we change.</p>
<p>“End of the project Brandon” is usually cursing “Beginning of the project Brandon” for using some library, not commenting his code, or lazily failing to follow best practices.</p>
<p>But not this time, oh no. This time WILL BE different&hellip;</p>
<p><em>(follow up post to come in 3 months making fun of this one)</em></p>
