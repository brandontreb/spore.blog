If they did, they would have found that it is a philosophical wake-up call disguised as a bunch of life hacks. The whole book is basically him channeling the energy of poet Mary Oliver and yelling, “Don’t waste your wild and precious life!” \r\n\r\nWhen I read The 4 Hour Workweek in 2010, it had a profound impact on my life and trajectory. \r\n\r\nOf course, I never believed I would work the literal 4 hour workweek, but the idea of questioning work and it’s role in my life was incredibly powerful. \r\n\r\nI owe so much of my professional success today to Ferris and this book and it’s still relevant all of these years later. \n",
