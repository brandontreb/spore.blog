  "content": "[This article][1] was a very interesting with some insight into the Android Market. Basically, this indie Android developer has published 6 free applications and is making more than $1,000.00 per month off of advertisements.\n\n\u003e None of my apps has been ever promoted in Top of Android Market\n\u003e \n\u003e I am providing only free apps (mostly due of Android Market limitations)\n\u003e \n\u003e Even if I would be able to sell apps I would not use it as main income source… (I believe that you still can make more from ads…)\n\nvia [Android Developer Income Report][1].\n\nI think there is an interesting experiment here. I am going to attempt this. Making super simple novelty apps (very low barrier to entry) that are free with ad support. I know this just further convolutes the crap that is the Android Market, but it would be fun to test.\n\nIf I actually end up doing this, I will publish some results here.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"RE: Android Developer Income Report\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/re-android-developer-income-report\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://www.kreci.net/reports/android-developer-income-report/\n",
