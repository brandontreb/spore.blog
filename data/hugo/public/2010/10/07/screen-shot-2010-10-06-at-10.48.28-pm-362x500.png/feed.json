  "content": "After a week of studying my butt off with OpenGL ES, I have finally started work on my game engine for my [Pov\u0026#8217;s Challenge][1] game.\n\nAs you can tell from the screenshot below, I have been playing entirely too much Minecraft and have cube art on the brain.\n\nIt\u0026#8217;s not much right now, but I do have a basic cube rendering engine that takes in a level file and renders the environment. Here is a screenshot of a very simple level.\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-962 alignleft\" title=\"Screen shot 2010-10-06 at 10.48.28 PM\" src=\"/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-10.48.28-PM-362x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"400\" /\u003e][2]It\u0026#8217;s not looking super killer at the moment, but I have yet to do fancier lighting or any texture mapping.\n\n**Ohh My Game Idea You Ask?**\n\nWell, without going into too much detail, it\u0026#8217;s pretty much an epic battle of mass proportion set in a 3D cube environment (hint: it\u0026#8217;s not iMinecraft ;)).\n\nI will give more details as I go about the month and near the completion of my game.\n\nAlso, in case you are interested, here is what the level file looks like for the generated environment.\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nG,G,G,GG,G,G,G\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nGG,G,G,G,G,G,GG\nGG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\nThe number of G\u0026#8217;s that appear represent the height at that location.\n\n**The current roadmap is:**\n\n  * Texturing \u0026 Lighting\n  * Collision Detection / Navigation\n  * Gameplay \u0026 Audio\n  * AI\n  * Menus / Title / Pause ([secret sauce ingredients][3])\n\nBy next week, I should have some sort of level editor and some basic skinning going on.\n\nHopefully I can finish this sucker by the end of the month. Its\u0026#8217;s been an intense journey learning openGL from scratch in 7 days and I know that I still have quite a ways to go. Again, if you are participating in this challenge, link me to your development blog in the comments.\n\nHappy coding!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"PoV\u0026#8217;s Challenge: Week 1\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/povs-challenge-week-1\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/09/22/povs-challenge-make-a-game-sell-1-copy/\n [2]: http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-10.48.28-PM.png\n [3]: http://www.36peas.com/blog/2010/10/6/just-add-the-secret-sauce-a-tried-and-tested-recipe-for-a-fi.html\n",
