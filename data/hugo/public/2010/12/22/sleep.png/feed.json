Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.\n\nLater in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming. He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed. My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice \u0026#8220;Does he have a memory leak?\u0026#8221;\n\nI laughed so hard it woke her up. I then appropriately responded with \u0026#8220;I have to go take a memory leak\u0026#8221;.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Does He Have A Memory Leak?\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/does-he-have-a-memory-leak\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
