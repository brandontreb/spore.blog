Curious, I researched the benefits and decided to \u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8\u0026tag=codnerandnon-20\u0026linkCode=as2\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epurchase one\u003c/a\u003e for my home office. The benefits include:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  * Improved posture \u0026#8211; sitting on the ball forces you to sit up straight of you won\u0026#8217;t be very comfortable\n  * Constant movement \u0026#8211; Sitting for long periods of time can be bad for you, even when you exercise. Check out this [recent study][1] that was discussed on the New York Times. When you use an exercise ball for a chair, you are constantly repositioning yourself and are combatting this issue.\n  * Getting Jacked! \u0026#8211; having a ball for a chair has encouraged me to exercise during my down time. Code is compiling\u0026#8230;bang out some crunches. I will now do ~ 300 crunches per day while waiting for various tasks to complete.\n  * They are cheap \u0026#8211; Most exercise balls range from $15-$25. [Check out Amazon for some deals][2]. I recently purchased one at Target on sale for $9.\n  * It\u0026#8217;s fun \u0026#8211; Need a break? Just bounce a bit on the ball ðŸ˜‰\n\nWhile I\u0026#8217;m not saying to completely replace your office chair with an exercise ball (you will end up switching back an fourth a bit), it is a great way to stay in shape and enforce good posture while at work.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Simple Office Fitness: Replace Your Office Chair With An Exercise Ball\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/simple-office-fitness-replace-your-office-chair-with-an-exercise-ball\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/phys-ed-the-men-who-stare-at-screens/\n [2]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8\u0026tag=codnerandnon-20\u0026linkCode=as2\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A\n",
