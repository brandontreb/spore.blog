It has been an absolute joy to play the games from my childhood. \r\n\r\nThere are so many NES and SNES games that I started, but could never complete when I was a kid. This little device is a joy to revisit them on. \r\n\r\nStarting last month, I convinced my buddy Will to buy one as well and we started a monthly retro gaming club. \r\n\r\n### The rules are simple:\r\n\r\n- Pick a game that the system supports (it runs all systems N64 and below)\r\n- The game must have an average play through time less than 10 hours\r\n- Guides are ok\r\n- Save states are ok\r\n- Every month we switch off who chooses the game\r\n- Have fun completing revisiting and completing the games from our childhood. \r\n\r\nLast month’s game was [The Legend of Zelda](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) for NES. \r\n\r\nIt was so much fun revisiting this game. I remember renting it when I was 6-9ish and immediately returning it to Boockbuster because it was _too_ hard. \r\n\r\nWell, it’s still too hard, but I was able to beat it in under 10 hours this time around. It was definitely a grind and Im glad to have it under my belt, but I don’t anticipate playing it again any time soon. \r\n\r\nThe game was impossible to play without walkthroughs (due to the nature of the secrets). It makes me wonder how 80’s kids ever got through it. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you decide to follow along and play through the games with us. I will be sure to announce them as they are selected. \r\n\n",
