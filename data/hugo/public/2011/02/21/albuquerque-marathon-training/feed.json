The marathon I\u0026#8217;m training for is the [Albuquerque Half Marathon][1] on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).\n\nTwo months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first \u0026#8220;real\u0026#8221; run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive. Right now, I am running about 3-4 miles per day with a longer day of ~5 miles. As the weeks pass, I intend on upping that to ~5 miles/day with a longer run at about 10 miles.\n\nIf any of you are training for something similar, I would love any advice, feedback, criticism, encouragement, stories, etc\u0026#8230; that you have. Just post em in the comments.\n\nAlso, for those of you who are on **nike+**, please befriend me. My username is (you guessed it) **brandontreb**.\n\nI\u0026#8217;m very excited about this goal and will be blogging along the way (amidst my other coding related posts of course).\n\n**It\u0026#8217;s a long road ahead ðŸ˜‰**\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Albuquerque Marathon Training\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/albuquerque-marathon-training\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://www.active.com/running/albuquerque-nm/albuquerque-half-marathon-2011\n",
