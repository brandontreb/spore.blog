  "name": "WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again",  
  "content": "Earlier this year, I jumped ship on WordPress and moved to Jekyll after reading [this post][1] on Hacker News. I wanted to be 1337! I wanted to ditch the whale that was WordPress.\n\nWell, it was quite a run, but in the end I decided to revert back to WordPress. Although Jekyll is **much faster** than WordPress, here were my issues:\n\n#### Build Times\n\nAs my post count grew, so did the time to compile my jekyll site. Jekyll is a static site builder, so naturally it has to rebuild your site any time anything changes. With my blog containing hundreds of posts, my site build times started getting into minutes. I simply don\u0026#8217;t want to wait forever to publish a post.\n\nSince it took **so long** to build my site, it discouraged me from posting. I would only write posts on my specified [#iDevBlogADay][2] days, rather than just posting quick info posts.\n\n#### Too Many Dependancies\n\nJekyll is a beast to install, especially if you want to support some of the fancier plugins like syntax highlighting. This limited my blogging to only *my* machines. I couldn\u0026#8217;t blog from anywhere anymore. I could have installed Jekyll on my server, but that just seems like a hassle, also see my first point about build times.\n\n#### No Mobile App\n\nI like to blog on the go, and with Jekyll I just couldn\u0026#8217;t find an elegant solution to blog from my iPhone or iPad. I found myself trying to come up with hackish solutions and write custom scripps, but in the end it just wasn\u0026#8217;t worth it.\n\n#### I can now use Markdown with WordPress\n\nI fell in love with Jekyll because I could write in markdown. With [this plugin][3], I can now do just that with WordPress. It stores the Markdown in a separate meta field and generates the post_content html upon publishing the post. So, I\u0026#8217;m not married to the plugin in case I decide to ditch it.\n\nI have also hid the disgusting \u0026#8220;Visual Editor\u0026#8221; that WordPress is unfortunate enough to ship with. This makes my writing experience much more pleasant.\n\n#### The Future\n\nWhile Jekyll was a fun experiment, I think I will stick with WordPress for now.\n\n**geekCred\u0026#8211;;**\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/\n [2]: http://idevblogaday.com\n [3]: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save-improved/\n",
