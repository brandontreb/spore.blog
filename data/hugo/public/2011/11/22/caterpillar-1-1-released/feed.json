  "content": "I have just released the update to my Centipede clone called [Caterpillar][1]. For those of you who don\u0026#8217;t know, I am doing a 6 part series on how to create this game over at [MobileTuts+][2].\u003c/p\u003e \n\nThis update adds some interesting functionality on which I will be blogging about in the near future.\n\nI have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads. This was achieved by creating a new Admob ad view inside of the `bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:` delegate method.\n\nI will either post a full tutorial about doing this Here or on Mobile Tuts. Either way, I\u0026#8217;ll keep you posted.\n\nAlso, be sure to [download the game][1], test it out, and lemme know if you have suggestions. Version 1.1 addressed quite a few issues from feedback (namely poor controls).\n\nHappy coding!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Caterpillar 1.1 Released\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/caterpillar-1-1-released\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-hd/id479439790?mt=8\n [2]: http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/building-a-caterpiller-game-with-cocos2d/\n",
