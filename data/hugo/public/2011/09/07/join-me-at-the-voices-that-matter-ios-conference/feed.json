It will be my third time attending, and I can\u0026#8217;t recommend it enough. One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor. A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.\n\nWe intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand. Bleh, that sounds kind of spammy. But, we have been working on something incredibly killer and I can\u0026#8217;t wait to share it with all of you.\n\n**If YOU are planning on attending the conference**, please comment on this post, [write me on Twitter][2], or email me. I\u0026#8217;d love to set up a one on one time to give you the full demo.\n\nAlso, I\u0026#8217;m sure many of you already have a discount code, but if not, I have a pretty sweet promo code for $100!\n\n#### BSTBLOG\n\nEnter that at checkout. Combining that with the \u0026#8220;Early Bird Pricing\u0026#8221;, you save $300! Not a bad deal.\n\nSo, if you do end up coming (you are crazy not to), please communicate with me. At least to say hi, you don\u0026#8217;t *have* to here my super awesome sales spiel if you don\u0026#8217;t want to\u0026#8230;\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n\u003cspan style=\"font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family: arial, verdana, tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e﻿﻿This post is part of \u003ca style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #004199; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://idevblogaday.com/\"\u003eiDevBlogADay\u003c/a\u003e, a group of indie iOS development blogs featuring two posts per day.
