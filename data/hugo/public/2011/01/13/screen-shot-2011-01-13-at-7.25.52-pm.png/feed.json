  "content": "Imagine that you have just found the coolest app in the world and just can\u0026#8217;t wait to tell all of your followers about it. So, you head to the admin panel of your blogging engine (hopefully [WordPress][1]) and begin to write your review. Now, you want to insert some screenshots, icons, descriptions, app store links, etc\u0026#8230; So, what do you do? You head on over to Bing and type in google.com. Next, you search your app name and hopefully find the iTunes URL so that you can slowly grab some information about the app. \u003cspan style=\"color: #ff0000;\"\u003e#Fail\u003c/span\u003e\n\nDum duh dum duh (trumpet noises)!\n\nEnter \u003ca href=\"http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAppBlogger\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAppBlogger\u003c/a\u003e is a little tool that I have been working on that uses \u0026#8220;Instant Search\u0026#8221; technology (jquery fanciness) to allow you to instantly search the app store and **quickly** get the information you need.\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1383\" title=\"Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 7.17.04 PM\" src=\"/uploads/2011/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-7.17.04-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"468\" /\u003e][2]\n\n**How Does It Work?** (you say)\n\nAs you start typing, \u003ca href=\"http://brandontreb.com/apps/appBlogger/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAppBlogger\u003c/a\u003e makes an asynchronous request to the iTunes web service and pulls a list of applications that match your search terms. This list is presented as a bunch of icons. You will then click on one of these icons to pull of the details page of that application.\n\n\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1387 alignleft\" title=\"Screen shot 2011-01-13 at 7.25.52 PM\" src=\"/uploads/2011/Screen-shot-2011-01-13-at-7.25.52-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"227\" /\u003e\n\nThe details page (see above screenshot) then contains everything you need to write a stellar blog post about that application. It provides text fields (for easy copy and paste) with icon URLs, download URL, and screenshot URLs.\n\nI have some plans to integrate this in the *near* future with my [Link Share][3] tool to auto generate shortened URLs that contain your affiliate code (so you can make $). If you have any other suggestions for it, I would love to hear them.\n\nI know many of you are heartbroken and were expecting the next iteration of my [Twitter Client For Mac][4] series. I want you to know, you are not forgotten and I will continue the series next Thursday. So Stay Tuned!\n\nCheck out [AppBlogger][5]!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’;\"\u003e\n  \u003cspan style=\"font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: normal;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family: arial, verdana, tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e﻿﻿This post is part of \u003ca style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #004199; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" href=\"http://idevblogaday.com/\"\u003eiDevBlogADay\u003c/a\u003e, a group of indie iOS development blogs featuring two posts per day.
