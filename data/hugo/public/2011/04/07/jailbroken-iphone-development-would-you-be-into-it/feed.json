I love the power, being able to hack *anything* on the device. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.\n\nMy most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an [inPulse watch][1]. It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard. I will do a full writeup on this in the near future, but basically it forwards all of your phone\u0026#8217;s notifications (SMS, Local, Push, Calendar) to your watch!\n\n#### Serious Lack Of Resources\n\nInPulseNotifier was a blast to create, however I found it **incredibly** challenging to find many resources about doing jailbroken development. I finally found [theos][2] which was a total lifesaver. Also, I had the code for [mobileNotifier][3] to follow along with.\n\nIRC (yeah I\u0026#8217;m a true hacker ;)) was also huge help, but there simply aren\u0026#8217;t enough tutorials/examples on the web related to jailbroken iPhone dev. My guesses are either 1. it\u0026#8217;s quite hard, 2. there\u0026#8217;s not enough \u003cfont color\"green\"\u003e$$$\u003c/font\u003e in it, or 3. jailbreakers like to stay \u0026#8220;underground\u0026#8221;.\n\nI haven\u0026#8217;t quite figured it out, but I was curious what YOU thought about it as I\u0026#8217;m considering doing some jailbroken iOS development tutorials on my blog. Please let me know in the comments. Are you down to \u0026#8220;Hack the planet\u0026#8221;?\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Jailbroken iPhone Development - Would You Be Into It?\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/jailbroken-iphone-development-would-you-be-into-it\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://getinpulse.com\n [2]: http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started\n [3]: http://www.peterhajas.com/blog/2011/2/27/mobilenotifier-beta3-copious-corn-flakes-1.html\n",
