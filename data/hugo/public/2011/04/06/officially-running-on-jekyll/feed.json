  "content": "Well, I have finally made the switch from [WordPress][1] to [Jekyll][2] and couldn\u0026#8217;t be happier. Here are some of the bonuses I have seen thus far.\n\n  1. SPEED: Just click around on my site. It is screaming fast now.\n  2. Resources: Checking top on my server reveals that I have a TON of extra resources (which makes sense since Jekyll sites are way more lightweight).\n  3. Ease of blogging: Ok, WordPress was pretty easy too, however, I was really starting to get sick of the post interface. I switch to Tumblr at some point simply for it\u0026#8217;s minimalist interface. WordPress\u0026#8217; is gross and TinyMCE (the WYSIWG editor) is terrible. I love writing in TextMate!\n  4. Offline publishing. I can write my posts anywhere since they are just .md (markdown) files. Check out [Daring Fireball\u0026#8217;s][3] great writeup on this.\n  5. Portability: Have you have tried to move your WordPress site? Yeah, it\u0026#8217;s about as fun as chewing on tin foil with metal fillings.\n  6. Focus on content: WordPress has quite a bit of focus on using rich media in your posts which tends to take away from the content if you are not careful. There is something about writing in a text editor that makes you forget about images/video/etc\u0026#8230; unless it\u0026#8217;s totally needed. So don\u0026#8217;t be surprised if my posts aren\u0026#8217;t as \u0026#8220;rich\u0026#8221;. (Hopefully they will be more clever \u003cimg src=\"http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /\u003e )\n\nI really urge you to see for yourself what it\u0026#8217;s like blogging with Jekyll. I will do a writeup on my conversion process in the near future to help aid others in the switch. Until then, you can google around and find tons of great resources.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Officially Running On Jekyll\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/officially-running-on-jekyll\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://wordpress.org\n [2]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n [3]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\n",
