This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.\n\nOnce connect, all of your computer\u0026#8217;s http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you **free tethering**. Since this isn\u0026#8217;t using the iPhone\u0026#8217;s built-in tethering method, I\u0026#8217;d assume At\u0026t could not detect it\u0026#42;. After looking at the code, it becomes pretty obvious how the SOCKS proxy works and makes me kick myself that I didn\u0026#8217;t write it (or find this code sooner).\n\nThe [setup][3] is a little complex, but you only need to do it once. I would love to hear in the comments if any of you has had some experience with this. I will also share my own as soon as I can get it installed later today.\n\nDownload the project over at [github][4].\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n\u003csub\u003e\u0026#42;This has not been verified by me\u003c/sub\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Tether Your iPhone Without Jailbreaking (Or Paying For It)\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/tether-your-iphone-without-jailbreaking-or-paying-for-it\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://tether.com\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS\n [3]: https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy/wiki/Configuring-iProxy\n [4]: https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy\n",
