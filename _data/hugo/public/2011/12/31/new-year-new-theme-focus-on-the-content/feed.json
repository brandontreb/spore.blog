  "content": "As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.\n\nI have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:\n\n  * [Jekyll][1] as my \u0026#8220;blog engine\u0026#8221;\n  * [The WPTypo WordPress Theme][2] I ported this to Jekyll\n  * [GitHub][3] for hosting (it\u0026#8217;s free).\n  * Vim \u0026#8211; I\u0026#8217;m using this as my \u0026#8220;blog editor\u0026#8221;. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)\n\nThat\u0026#8217;s about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is **always** backed up and easily accessible.\n\n2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on [iCodeBlog][4], I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the [Envato Network][5]. You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D [here][6].\n\nI can\u0026#8217;t wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn\u0026#8217;t really lend itself to visuals ;).\n\nHappy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"New Year - New Theme: Focus On The Content\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/new-year-new-theme-focus-on-the-content\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://jekyllrb.com\n [2]: http://www.wptux.com/206/wp-typo\n [3]: https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com\n [4]: http://icodeblog.com\n [5]: http://envato.com\n [6]: http://mobile.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-caterpillar-game-with-cocos2d/\n",
