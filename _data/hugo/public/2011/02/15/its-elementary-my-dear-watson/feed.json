For those of you who don\u0026#8217;t know, IBM has been working for some time on a system (named Watson) that has overcome some amazing challenges. The goal: to build an entirely self-contained system that can beat the World\u0026#8217;s best Jeopardy players.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nNow, I\u0026#8217;m not going to give you a rundown on it as I\u0026#8217;m sure that you can (or have already) read it on a website far more popular than mine. I just wanted to publicly geek out for a second\u0026#8230;\n\nI was watching the episode of Jeopardy with my wife, and at first glance she was like \u0026#8220;duh, of course a computer could win at Jeopardy\u0026#8221;. This made me realize that to a non engineer, this seems like a trivial task since computers are magical Facebook boxes.\n\nNow me on the other hand, I was giddy to the point of almost wetting myself. Seeing how far we have come in AI development and language processing is absolutely incredible.\n\nI for one, will be glued to my tv tonight to watch Watson\u0026#8217;s next round of Jeopardy.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"It\u0026#8217;s Elementary My Dear Watson\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/its-elementary-my-dear-watson\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
