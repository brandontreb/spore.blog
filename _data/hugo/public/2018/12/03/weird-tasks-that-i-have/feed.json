  "content": "Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a [converted schoolbus](http://trebventure.com). \n\nToday, I had quite a few “bus chores” and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd. \n\n- Change composting toilet \n- Fill up propane tanks\n- Add heat tape to fresh water lines\n- Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking\n\nSometimes I wonder if I have _more_ chores on the bus than in a traditional home. \n\nWhatever, off to chop wood for my [tiny wood stove](http://www.instagram.com/trebventure/p/Bj47D7hn2U9/)...\n\n",
