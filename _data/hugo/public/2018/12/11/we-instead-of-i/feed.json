  "content": "When I first started consulting, I had everything tied to my name. My company name was Treb Studios, my email was brandon@brandontreb.com, and my whole business was tied to me. \n\nThis was fine for a while...until I started growing. I hired contractors with the intention of replacing myself on my existing projects. This proved to be _very_ challenging. \n\nClients didn’t want other developers, they wanted Brandon, because that’s what they were promised. \n\nIt wasn’t until I started using “we” language instead of “I” language that clients fully accepted my other team members. Changing the language also had a profound effect on how I perceived the company. I began looking at everything as a real company rather than just me hacking on the side. \n\nSo, if you are building a company (even if it’s just you), start using the term “we” instead of “I” from day one. It will make the transition _much_ easier when you start growing, and it will make you feel like you are actually building something beyond yourself. \n\n",
