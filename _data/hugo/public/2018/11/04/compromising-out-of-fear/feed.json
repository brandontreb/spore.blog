  "content": "Seth Godin [recently discussed](https://overcast.fm/+Kebvif_ik) in an episode of the Tim Ferris Show a fear many of us have of the future. He used the example of him landing speaking gigs in which he was more apt to compromise and take gigs he didnâ€™t particularly want on months in which no gigs were currently booked. \n\nAs someone in the consulting space, I can absolutely identify with this. In the past, I have taken clients in knowing very well that they will mostly be problematic (funding, difficult, or otherwise). This was out of fear that work might dry up any minute. I know this fear is unfounded as work has consistently come in over the past 6 years of running my company, however sometimes it still creeps in. \n\nDo you deal with this kind of fear. If so, how do you overcome it? \n\n",
