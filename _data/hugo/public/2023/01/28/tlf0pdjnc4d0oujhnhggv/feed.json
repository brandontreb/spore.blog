This is my story.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, a client of mine asked me to build them a DApp (distributed app) on the Ethereum blockchain. At that time, ETH was trading around $100 USD per coin.\r\n\r\nThe client, being super into crypto, offered to pay me in Ethereum only. [My consultancy](https://pixegon.com) was already doing fairly well at the time and I didn't _really_ need the money from the contract (around $100k USD).  This would have amounted to me acquiring around 1,000 ETH. But, still being skeptical of crypto, I declined his offer and took the cash instead.\r\n\r\n**Huge mistake.**\r\n\r\nAs many if your might know, at the crypto peak in 2022, Ethereum was trading at around $4,500 USD per coin.\r\n\r\nDoing the math, that contract would now be worth over $4.5 million USD! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\r\n\r\nI honestly don't regret the decision to take the cash, as I now have a great story to tell.  I love telling my kids and them telling me what a complete idiot I am.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll have to wait a little longer on buying the Lambo.\r\n\r\n_Do you have a crazy crypto story? I'd love to hear about it._\r\n\r\n\r\n\n",
