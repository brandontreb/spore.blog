  "content": "I have updated my WordPress plugin Feedburner Anywhere. In case you are unfamiliar with it, it\u0026#8217;s a plugin that allows you to output your Feedburner subscriber count anywhere on your blog.\n\n**The Problem: **Since Google took over Feedburner, I feel that it has been quite unreliable. A few times a week, Feedburner would return 0 for your subscriber count. This was an issue with the plugin. If the return value was 0 when the plugin pulled and cached the feedburner data, you would look like you had no subscribers.\n\n**The Fix:** I am now caching the values returned from Feedburner. If for any reason Feedburner returns a 0 subscriber count, the last known value (greater than 0) is used instead.\n\n[Download the updated plugin here][1]\n\nIf you have any other suggestions for the plugin, please let me know.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Feedburner Anywhere Plugin Updated\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/feedburner-anywhere-plugin-updated\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-anywhere/\n",
