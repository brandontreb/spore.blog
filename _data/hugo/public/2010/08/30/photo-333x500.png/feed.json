I loaded it up in the browser and long behold, even the browser threw an error. But what could be causing this? Turns out, I had left a space in a plugin that I created. This caused a space to be output at the beginning of the comments XML, causing it to error. Notice the space between ?\u003e and \u003c?php below. (Face Palm)\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"size-full wp-image-860 alignnone\" title=\"Screen shot 2010-08-30 at 10.05.22 AM\" src=\"http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-30-at-10.05.22-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"180\" /\u003e][3]\n\nAfter removing the space from this plugin, I loaded up WordPress for iPhone and it added my blog without a problem.\n\nSo, the take away from this is **don\u0026#8217;t output spaces when you create a plugin.**\n\nI hope this post has proven useful for you, I can\u0026#8217;t imagine that I\u0026#8217;m the only person with this issue ðŸ˜‰\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Wordpress For iPhone/iPad NSXMLParserErrorDomain Error 64 Resolved\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-for-iphoneipad-nsxmlparsererrordomain-error-64-resolved\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8\n [2]: http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo.png\n [3]: http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-30-at-10.05.22-AM.png\n",
