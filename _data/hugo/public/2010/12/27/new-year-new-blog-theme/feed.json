I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.\n\nAfter setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (\u003chttp://brownbishop.com\u003e), I fell in love with the[ Standard WordPress Theme][1]. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it\u0026#8217;s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.\n\nSo, I urge you to [check it out][1], It\u0026#8217;s kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"New Year, New Blog Theme\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/new-year-new-blog-theme\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601\u0026c=ib\u0026aff=149540\u0026cl=64302\n",
