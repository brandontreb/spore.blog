  "content": "Ok, so maybe this is stupid, reposting your own content in multiple areas. As far as SEO goes, it may not be the best idea. However, I really love Tumblr and I really love WordPress. I can\u0026#8217;t seem to part with either yet I don\u0026#8217;t quite have the time for both.\n\nI put out a quick tweet earlier today (and this is why I flippin love Twitter), asking if anyone knew of a good way to connect WordPress to Twitter. Here are the popular options.\n\n  1. Use Tumblr\u0026#8217;s feed importer (suggested by [@abrahamvegh][1]). This option requires you to enter your blog\u0026#8217;s RSS feed. Tumblr then scans your RSS feed every so often and pulls the new posts. I didn\u0026#8217;t care too much for this approach because it\u0026#8217;s not instantaneous. I added my feed and it told me that it would refresh in about an hour. After an hour it still didn\u0026#8217;t pull my WordPress posts and had a status of queued.  \n    [\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-919\" title=\"Screen shot 2010-09-16 at 10.20.58 PM\" src=\"/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.20.58-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"253\" /\u003e][2]\n  2. [][2] There are quite a few Tumblr WordPress plugins out there. I have tried a few and have seen no success. Until one of my twitter followers (**[@TheSilber][3]) **suggested that I use [tumblrize][4]. Tumblrize is a great plugin that worked perfectly right out of the box. It was easy to set up and boasts quite a few options.\u0026#8221;Tumblrize posts to Tumblr whenever you hit the \u0026#8220;publish\u0026#8221; button. It uses Tumblr\u0026#8217;s simple API to keep posts in sync; when you edit your WordPress post, it updates your Tumblr post.\u0026#8221;  \n    \u003cimg class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Tumblrize\" src=\"http://id.ijulien.com/img/tumblrize.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"49\" /\u003e\n\nI would highly recommend option 2 if you are planning on syncing your WordPress blog with your Tumblr.\n\n[Download Tumblr.ize Here][4]\n\nWould love to hear about some other interesting solutions. Feel free to post them in the comments.\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Great WordPress Plugin To Connect Your WordPress Blog To Your Tumblr\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/great-wordpress-plugin-to-connect-your-wordpress-blog-to-your-tumblr\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://twitter.com/abrahamvegh\n [2]: /uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.20.58-PM.png\n [3]: http://twitter.com/#!/TheSilber\n [4]: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tumblrize/\n",
