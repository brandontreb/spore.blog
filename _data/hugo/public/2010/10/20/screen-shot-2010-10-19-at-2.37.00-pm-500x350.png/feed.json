  "content": "So another week has gone by and I have made quite a bit of progress, here are the additions since I last posted.\n\n  * Texturing\n  * Lighting\n  * Skybox\n  * Better Terrain generation\n  * Environment Fog\n  * Basic navigation\n\nSo judging by the screenshot, you might really be thinking that I\u0026#8217;m working on Minecraft for the iPhone (I used textures that someone created for Minecraft). While this isn\u0026#8217;t my intention, it is starting to look like my engine would be perfect for a simple port. Perhaps, I may consider creating something inspired by Minecraft in the future. For now, I will be sticking to my current game idea which I call Cube Hive.\n\nAs I continue to update this blog, the game idea will become more and more apparent but basically I want to create a game [similar to this][1] on the iPhone in a cube environment.\n\nAnyway, here is a screenshot of where I\u0026#8217;m at:\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-983 alignnone\" title=\"Screen shot 2010-10-19 at 2.37.00 PM\" src=\"/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-10-19-at-2.37.00-PM-500x350.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"350\" /\u003e][2]\n\nOh, and BTW doing Fog in OpenGL ES is crazy easy. Here is the code (thanks to [Mike Daley][3] of [71 Squared][4] for showing me this)\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \u003cpre\u003e\u0026lt;code class=’objc’\u003eGLfloat fogColor[] = {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f};\n    glFogf(GL_FOG_MODE, GL_LINEAR);\n    glFogfv(GL_FOG_COLOR, fogColor);\n    glFogf(GL_FOG_DENSITY, 0.5f);\n    glHint(GL_FOG_HINT, GL_DONT_CARE);\n    glFogf(GL_FOG_START, 10);\n    glFogf(GL_FOG_END, 20);\n    glEnable(GL_FOG);\u0026lt;/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThat\u0026#8217;s it! Such a great effect with so little effort.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0026#8217;t foresee my game being completed by the end of this month for the Ludum Dare competition. However, I have been working on a killer MUD client for the iPhone that I will most likely submit. I feel that current solutions are clunky, ugly, and unintuitive (sorry if you are a reader and a dev of one of these :/).\n\nI should have some screenshots up soon.\n\nI would love to hear thoughts/opinions of doing a Minecraft inspired game as well?\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Ludum Dare Competition: Week 2 Update\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/ludum-dare-competition-week-2-update\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://sites.google.com/site/handkor/hive’sprojectpage\n [2]: http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-19-at-2.37.00-PM.png\n [3]: http://twitter.com/#!/mikedaley\n [4]: http://www.71squared.com/\n",
