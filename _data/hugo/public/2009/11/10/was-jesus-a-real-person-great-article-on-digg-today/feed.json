  "content": "The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled \u0026#8221;[Was Jesus A Real Person?][1]\u0026#8221;. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.\n\nI found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out. [Take a look for yourself ][2]and let me know what you think.\n\n[Article Link][2]\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Was Jesus A Real Person?
