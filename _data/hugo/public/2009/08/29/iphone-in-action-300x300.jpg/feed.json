I found this question a little odd so I responded with \u0026#8220;like a girl or a developer?\u0026#8221;. I often tweet about my wife, so I was hoping he was not referring to a girl. He replied with \u0026#8220;no, someone at Manning Publishing, they are looking for an author for their book iPhone In Action\u0026#8221;. So, I was put in contact with Manning and they eventually offered me the position as one of the authors on the book iPhone In Action.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n  iPhone In Action is a book (that is already out) and details how to program for the webkit as well as the native iPhone OS. I will be removing the webkit chapters, updating some of the dated chapters, and writing about 6 new chapters related to OS 3.0.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n  I will be posting about the book and my progress along the way (don\u0026#8217;t worry I won\u0026#8217;t stop my random tutorials about Twitter, WordPress, etc\u0026#8230;). Just wanted to share that and say go out and buy the book (in December when I am finished and will get the commission \u003cimg src=\"http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /\u003e ).\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\n  Happy Coding!\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"iPhone In Action Book\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/iphone-in-action-book\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
