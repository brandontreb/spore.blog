These will be anywhere from objective-c to ruby on rails to .NET. Whatever strikes my fancy.\n\nAlong the road, I will also be sharing my art (photo and drawing) as well as anything else I find interesting.\n\nSo just sit back and enjoy the magic of code!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"The Focus Of This Blog\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/the-focus-of-this-blog\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
