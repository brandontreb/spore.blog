If you are a fan of the game Catch-Phrase, then you will love Buzzword.\n\nIn this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues \u0026#8211; talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don\u0026#8217;t want to be caught with the game at the buzz. \u003c/p\u003e \n\n### Game Controls:\n\n**Start/Stop** \u0026#8211; Starts and stops the timer\n\n**Category **\u0026#8211; Selects a category\n\n**Team1** \u0026#8211; Awards a point to team 1\n\n**Team 2** \u0026#8211; Awards a point to team 2\n\n**Next **\u0026#8211; Selects the next word to describe\u003c/p\u003e \n\n### Game Rules:\n\n\u003cspan\u003eTo play the game, players need to split up into two teams. \u003c/span\u003eYou should sit in a circle alternating every other person as a member on your team. \n\nFirst, the teams will need to decide on a category in which the words will come from. This is done by pressing the \u0026#8220;Category\u0026#8221; button. Next, pick a team to begin the game with the first word. \n\nThe game starts by pressing the \u0026#8220;start/stop\u0026#8221; button to start the timer. The player holding the iPhone/iPod will try to describe the word on the screen. They can say and do whatever they want without saying any of the words on the screen, saying \u0026#8220;rhymes with\u0026#8221;, or saying \u0026#8220;starts with\u0026#8221;. All of the members on their team will then try to guess the word or phrase the player is trying to describe.\n\nOnce the word has been guessed, the iPhone/iPod is passed to the next player on the opposite team. This player will press the \u0026#8220;Next\u0026#8221; button to receive a new word to describe.\n\nThe game is played until the buzzer goes off. At this point, the team NOT holding the iPhone/iPod gets a point. This is done by pressing either the \u0026#8220;Team 1\u0026#8221; or \u0026#8220;Team 2\u0026#8221; buttons. The first team to 7 wins!\u003c/p\u003e \n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or bug reports, feel free to comment on this page or [write me on Twitter (http://twitter.com/brandontreb)][1]\n\n[\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-98\" title=\"Download Buzzword In The App Store\" src=\"/uploads/2009/avail_on_app_store.png\" alt=\"Download Buzzword In The App Store\" width=\"166\" height=\"74\" /\u003e][2]\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Buzzword\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/buzzword\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://twitter.com/brandontreb\n [2]: http://tinyurl.com/at53fu\n",
