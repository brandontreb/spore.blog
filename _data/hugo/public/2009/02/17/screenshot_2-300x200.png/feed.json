  "content": "I have just submitted an iPhone app that I have been developing in my free time. The app is called Buzzword. It\u0026#8217;s basically a game similar to the game catchphrase. So wherever you go, you and your friends can bust out a game of Buzzword\u0026#8230;\n\nHere are some screenshots:\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-36 alignnone\" title=\"screenshot_3\" src=\"/uploads/2009/screenshot_3-300x200.png\" alt=\"screenshot_3\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\n\u003cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-35 alignnone\" title=\"screenshot_2\" src=\"/uploads/2009/screenshot_2-300x200.png\" alt=\"screenshot_2\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /\u003e\n\nOnce approved, Buzzword will only cost a buck. I\u0026#8217;m not kidding, it will probably be the best dollar you have spent and will spend in your entire life. Stay tuned, I\u0026#8217;ll be giving out promo codes to people at random\u0026#8230;\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"iPhone App: Buzzword Submitted to the App Store\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/iphone-app-buzzword-submitted-to-the-app-store\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n",
