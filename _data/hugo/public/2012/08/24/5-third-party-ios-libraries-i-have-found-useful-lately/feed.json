  "content": "As I mature as a developer, I try to rely on other people\u0026#8217;s code more an more. Why build something from scratch when a solution already exists that you can fit in your project. In [Pocket MUD Pro][1], I used **13** 3rd party libraries and am using quite a bit more in the project that I\u0026#8217;m currently working on. I figured that I would share some of the libraries that I have been using so that it might save you some time in the future.\n\n## 1. CocoaAsyncSocket\n\n**Link:** \u003chttps://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket\u003e\n\nMany of my applications involve TCP or UDP networking. There is a lot of boiler plate code involved in every networked application, and CocoaAsyncSocket solves much of that for you.\n\n## 2. Appirater\n\n**Link:** \u003chttp://github.com/arashpayan/appirater/\u003e\n\n![Screenshot][2]\n\nHopefully, you have heard of this one or a similar library by now. It\u0026#8217;s very challenging to get users to want to review your applications, let alone give you a positive review. AppiRater allows you to prompt a user to rate your application based on either number of launches or \u0026#8220;significant events\u0026#8221; which you specify.\n\n## 3. Zip Archive\n\n**Link:** \u003chttp://code.google.com/p/ziparchive/\u003e\n\nI try to ship small applications that download assets upon launch. A good way to send these assets over the wire is to zip them up and stick them on your server. I have written an article about this on [iCodeBlog][3].\n\n## 4. Quick Dialog\n\n**Link: ** \u003chttps://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog\u003e\n\nCreating forms in iOS is pretty painful. It usually involves custom table cells and a lot of delegate nonsense. QuickDialog takes away some of this pain and allows you to easily create iOS forms. You can even design them using JSON.\n\n![QuickDialog Screenshot][4]\n\n## 5. TSMiniWebBrowser\n\n**Link:** \u003chttps://github.com/tonisalae/TSMiniWebBrowser\u003e\n\nOften times, you want a quick and dirty browser in your application. I generally use it to point to in-app documentation or take the user to a page after tapping on a link. It\u0026#8217;s quick and easy.\n\n![Screenshot][5]\n\nI hope you find some value in this list. I\u0026#8217;d love to hear about the libraries **you** use frequently.\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"5 Third Party iOS Libraries I Have Found Useful Lately\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/5-third-party-ios-libraries-i-have-found-useful-lately\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-mud-pro/id511678455?mt=8\n [2]: http://arashpayan.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/AppiraterScreenshot.png\n [3]: http://www.icodeblog.com/2012/08/13/unzipping-files-using-zip-archive/\n [4]: https://github.com/escoz/QuickDialog/raw/master/other/quickdialog2.png\n [5]: https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/1cae2dfc9160aa6a8e0583d0682d78462c97d60f/687474703a2f2f646c2e64726f70626f782e636f6d2f752f373630343232322f4769744875622f54534d696e6957656242726f777365722f73686f745f30315f7468756d622e706e67\n",
