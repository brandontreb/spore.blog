  "content": "Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled [WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again][1] made it to the front page of Hacker News. I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my WordPress install.\n\nAt the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we\u0026#8217;ll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.\n\nAs you can imagine, the influx of HN traffic crashed the server multiple times and I was (with good reason) mocked in the comments (\u0026#8220;must be because he\u0026#8217;s \u0026#8216;back to WordPress\u0026#8217;\u0026#8221;). So, I asked for advice and further \u0026#8220;beefed up\u0026#8221; my setup switching from Apache to Nginx, upping the ram, and switching caching plugins. WordPress is a beast and hard to optimize. That\u0026#8217;s not even the kicker as to why I switched away.\n\n#### A Call From Rackspace\u0026#8230;\n\nAbout a month ago, I realized my blog was down. I figured that it might have been that I was featured somewhere else which was crashing it (again I was rolling my eyes at WordPress). But then, I got a call and email from a *very* helpful Rackspace employee. The email went like this:\n\n\u003e Despite the very best efforts of or our Engineering and Datacenter Operations Teams, unfortunately the host machine that your cloud server \u0026#8216;Websites\u0026#8217; resides on was not able to be recovered. At this point, we are looking at complete data loss.\n\nand\u0026#8230; Rackspace, in this poorly phrased email, was basically like. \u0026#8220;Well, sucks to be you, hope you had a backup!\u0026#8221;. Well, I admit this is partially my fault for not having a backup as I am a bit of a n00b when it comes to server admin, but I had been hosting for years on (don\u0026#8217;t judge me) GoDaddy before that and a couple years on Rackspace. I had no idea that hosting companies didn\u0026#8217;t have backups of their own. It would seem that this might be crucial to their business.\n\nNeedless to say, I lost everything including a jewelry site that I ran (not many sales), an iPhone leaderboard site (not very popular), 2 of my buddies WordPress blogs, and my current WordPress blog.\n\n#### Jekyll To The Rescue\n\nI was pretty angry at Rackspace and myself for never making a backup, but then it hit me that *most* of my posts had been converted to Jekyll and were backed up in a github repository. I was able to restore my blog within a few minutes (now hosted on GitHub) and recover the WordPress posts from the [Feedburner cache][2] of my site.\n\nAs for my buddies\u0026#8217; sites\u0026#8230; I feel for them \u003cimg src=\"http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png\" alt=\":(\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /\u003e\n\n#### New List Of Why Jekyll Is Awesome\n\n  * **Automatically backed up** \u0026#8211; This is huge. If not for switching to Jekyll at one point, I would have lost **years** worth of content. If you have every tried to back up WordPress, it\u0026#8217;s a huge frackin pain since the database dump usually gets HUGE.\n  * **Free To Host** \u0026#8211; I\u0026#8217;m not sure why I was so stubborn about doing my own hosting. I am now hosting on [GitHub][3] and it couldn\u0026#8217;t be more stable and fast.\n  * **Mobile Blogging** \u0026#8211; This was my largest gripe about Jekyll. I was jealous that I couldn\u0026#8217;t blog from my iPhone like WordPress users. Well, I have found a pretty decent solution (tutorial to follow), which involves a combo of Prompt, Screen, and Vim.\n  * **Content Oriented** \u0026#8211; WordPress makes it super easy to dump tons of images into your posts. While blogging with Jekyll (inside of Vim in my case), it\u0026#8217;s a little bit more of a pain to add your own images. That being said you must be choosy forcing you to focus more on the content and less on using visual crutches.\n  * **Blog Anywhere** \u0026#8211; This was another limitation I was placing on Jekyll in my last post. However, I just wasn\u0026#8217;t using Jekyll to its full potential. I was building my site locally and rsyncing it up to my server. This process was a little tedious and discouraged me from writing many new posts. Now, hosting with github, posting is as simple as a quick push to the repo.\n  * **Ninja Fast** \u0026#8211; This one should be obvious.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nI am quite happy blogging with Jekyll. As far as I\u0026#8217;m concerned there is no reason to ever host my own blog again (as long as Github doesn\u0026#8217;t ditch pages ðŸ˜‰ ). Also, if you currently have stuff on Rackspace, **go make a backup now** (or ditch them altogether). Thanks for reading and [look out][2] for my next post about mobile blogging with Jekyll.\n\nHappy Blogging!\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Why I Went Back To Jekyll - Also Rackspace Sucks\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/why-i-went-back-to-jekyll-also-rackspace-sucks\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/\n [2]: http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb\n [3]: https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com\n",
