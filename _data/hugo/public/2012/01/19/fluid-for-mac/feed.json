  "content": "As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought \u0026#8220;why don\u0026#8217;t I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get \u0026#8220;native web apps\u0026#8221; that have icons and are launchable?\u0026#8221;.\n\nAfter a quick Google search, I realized **[this already exists!][1]**. The app is called Fluid and it does an incredible job of what I described above and more.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"http://fluidapp.com/images/dock_large.png\" width=\"400\" /\u003e\n\nHere are the feature highlights.\n\n  * Create a \u0026#8220;native\u0026#8221; Mac app for any web app\n  * Custom icon for each \u0026#8220;native\u0026#8221; app you create\n  * Full screen mode\n  * User scripps. These are my favorite. They allow you to update the badge count based on information in the browser. See below for a sample user script.\n\n**Sample User Script For Twitter**\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \u003cpre\u003e\u0026lt;code class=’javascript’\u003e(function () {\n        if (window.fluid) {\n            setInterval(function updateBadge() {\n                var counts = /\\d+/.exec(document.title);\n                if (counts \u0026\u0026 counts[0] \u0026gt; 0) {\n                    window.fluid.dockBadge = counts[0] \u0026gt; 99 ? ‘99+’ : counts[0];\n                } else {\n                    window.fluid.dockBadge = ”;\n                }\n            }, 2000);\n        }\n    })();\u0026lt;/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n[Source][2]\n\nFluid is free with some minimal features, but I urge you to drop the $4.99 to gain full screen mode and user scripts. It\u0026#8217;s well worth it. I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a happy customer.\n\n[Download Fluid][1]\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n  \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-text=\"Fluid For Mac\" data-url=\"http://brandontreb.com/fluid-for-mac\"  data-via=\"brandontreb\" data-related=\"brandontreb:\"\u003eTweet\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n [1]: http://fluidapp.com/\n [2]: http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/88425\n",
