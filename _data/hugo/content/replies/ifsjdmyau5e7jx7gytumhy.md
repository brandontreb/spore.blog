Hey there! Thanks for the note. I have been through _so many_ coffee brewing systems (including the French Press). 

I keep coming back to the original [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/) 

It’s (relatively) inexpensive, portable, easy to use and very versatile. So I’d say it’s my #1 recommendation for a single-cup brewing system. Just Google “Aeropress recipes” and you will find such an interesting community around the various ways to brew coffee with it. 

You can buy from their site, Amazon, or most local coffee shops. 

Hope that helps!
