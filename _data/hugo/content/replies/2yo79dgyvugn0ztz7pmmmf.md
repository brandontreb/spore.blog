I love that you specify ”even if you own it”. Being a dev, I have implemented countless url shortening services and the like only to abandon them years (or even months) later. 

No one wants to “own” this software long term. Especially, when it’s a utility-based service with no ROI. 

I’m surprised anyone would use a shortening service in 2023. It seems like a relic of the old Twitter days with the sole purpose of providing a solution to the character limit.
