Sorry to hear about the layout Geoff.  I have been laid off before from a company where I invested much of my energy writing technical blog posts for their blog.  In my case, the company sold and the blog was eventually shut down. It's brutal to watch your work disappear like that. Hopefully, DO keeps CSS-Tricks going forward. Best of luck!
